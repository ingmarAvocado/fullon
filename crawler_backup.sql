Following the plan:

• Breakdown of the ascending broadening wedge✔️

• Retracement to the first trendline support, followed by a breakdown and retest of the second trendline support, creating a range between these two levels✔️ 

• Bounce on the ascending support just above the key horizontal level at $28401.86 (uptrend still in tact) ✔️

The bullish scenario remains valid as long as BTC consolidates above the key horizontal $28401. The current price action could be a bearish support/resistance flip before the breakdown, but we trade based on what we observe. Decision time now.

A) If you lean towards a bearish outlook, consider selling here and look to buy again above $29971.

B) If you lean towards a bullish outlook, maintain your stop loss below the key horizontal $28401.

In the current market landscape, the Nasdaq is inching closer to its all-time high of 16,556, being just 3.6% away.

Meanwhile, the DXY (U.S. Dollar Index) is losing steam once again. This combination creates the ideal environment for Bitcoin (BTC) and other riskier assets to thrive.

Why: 

🔵The DXY (U.S. Dollar Index) is experiencing a decline, further supporting risk-on sentiment.

🔵This setting bodes well for BTC and other riskier assets, enhancing their potential for growth.

🔶Historical data indicates that when Nasdaq regains significant levels, BTC usually catches up within approximately 80 days.

🔶The process often starts with the Nasdaq cooling off as capital rotates towards riskier assets.

🔵Once the rotation occurs, the Nasdaq tends to take off again, propelling BTC''s rise.

🔵A projected blow-off top requires aggressive growth across all asset classes.

Conclusion:

Keep a close eye on the Nasdaq and DXY dynamics for potential insights into BTC''s trajectory.

All Points clearly marked on the Chart.

2. Those who longed the nPOC tap from the Previous Post should be in good profit.

3. Main target remains weekly Open. 

4. 29.3k remains a crucial level, will cut long in profit below it of PA is Weak. 

5. Point 5 remains Major resistance zone and first target. Check on Chart. 

6. First attempt at range reclaim failed and OI flushed out. All pre-FOMC apes taken out.

Even though we are long, overall structure has turned cautious until weekly open reclaim is confirmed. 

We have broken down from a very important range and even though our HTF bias is bullish, we need to focus on what''s in front of us.

It is Exactly that Part of the Crypto Market.

You should be
1. Preparing your Entries on the Coin you like.
2. Arriving at your thesis for Exit. 
3. Building your friend trading Circle.
4. Levelling your Swing Trading Skills.
5. Working harder to get more Capital, by any means.
5.1. Prepare for Volatility to come back to BTC and ETH and Scalp the living day lights out of it, if you''re into that. 
6. Definitely stay away from influencers who Promise to give you the next 100x.

They will Dump 100 Pieces of absolute Garbage on you, making you the exit liquidity. ONE of those coins will 100x and it will be their claim to fame. 

So Prepare well. Nothing Beats a man with Big Capital, solid friend groups and the ability to manage risk. 

If you can''t do any of it, maybe just DCA now on some BlueChips and walk away for 18 Months. 

Yes we could Dump a Bit more if Powell gets more stupid but the Dump would look like a noodle in front of the Pump of Whales. 

About Recession? You can''t say a technical recession won''t occur but more literature has been written about recession in 2023 by analysts than any other event, in history.

It is very likely it will be front run or the entire Population is highly prepared for it. 

In Short, Prepare well, take risk, don''t use leverage to increase your Capital but to manage risk and Prepare of the next Ponzi Pump.

🔶S&P 500: The S&P 500 index has seen a modest reduction of 0.4%.
🔶Dow: The Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced a decline of 37 points.
🔶Nasdaq: The Nasdaq Composite Index has witnessed a slight downturn of 0.5%.

Cryptocurrency Correlation:

Remarkably, it has now surged to nearly 0.4.

The Tech Sector''s Impact:
The IT surge, driven by AI excitement, up over 40% this year, could potentially propel BTC to new heights.

BTC maintains its $27K stronghold as the wider crypto market remains relatively stagnant. Traders are keeping a keen eye on today''s central bank policy decisions (2:00pm EST) for any potential market shifts.

The likelihood of a significant hawkish or dovish surprise from the central bank is minimal, favouring BTC''s price trajectory.

The Bearish Bitcoin Fractal assumes price could still rally to even as high as ~$29,000 before additional downside

Key Technical Events

• Overextension beyond Bull Market Support Band (yellow circle) possible but a failed retest of the Band as support post-breakout and the fractal would stay intact

• Revisit of the Lower High resistance, upside wicking beyond it, but ultimate rejection there and the fractal would still be intact

Bitcoin Bearish Fractal Invalidation Criteria

a) Bull Market Support Band holds as support 

b) Weekly Close beyond Lower High resistance

c) Breach of $31k yearly highs

Short-term weakness, but a golden mid-term opportunity!

🔶According to the ETHBTC trading pair, it''s time to shift from BTC to altcoins.
🔶Hold on, BTC might shine briefly, but ETH is gearing up for a spectacular run!
🔶Avoid high-beta plays and focus on building a strong core portfolio for the upcoming bull market. 📈

If ~$29250 acts as resistance, then the chances of this Bear Div playing out are higher

Should that happen, what sort of downside could be expected this August?

It''s worth looking a historical downside in prior Augusts, with the emphasis on Pre-Halving years (2015 & 2019) 

After all - 2023 is currently a Pre-Halving year (i.e. Candle 3 in the 4-Year Cycle)

If $BTC were to repeat August 2015 downside, price could drop -18% to ~$24,000

If BTC were to repeat August 2019 downside, price could only slightly dip at -4% to ~$28000

Altcoins face challenges as most charts turn red; Ethereum (ETH) drops from $1.7k to $1.55k this week.

🔶It''s not just ETH feeling the heat; other major altcoins like Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, Tron, Polkadot, and Polygon are also deep in the red.

🟠With Bitcoin''s dominance climbing past 51%, inching closer to its 2021 peak, altcoins are indeed feeling the pressure.

To see the resurgence of the much-awaited Altcoins Season, a significant recovery will be essential.

1. Stay away from anyone who claims to be right all the time.

They are either lying or they don''t trade. You don''t need the opinions of such individuals. 

2. 99% of Crypto is Ponzi. It is even known to the founders and the Dev.

So stop trying to be a ''Supporter''.

Trade and get out.

3. Twitter is attention Economy. Influencers thrive on making you believe they deserve your attention.

A good judge of someone''s character is how hard they try to get your attention.

Stay away from someone who:

A. Constantly brags about being right.

B. Virtue signaling, trying to showcase themselves as a better human.

Most are either trying to use you as an exit liquidity or get
 you to join their paid group.

Trust no one, doubt everyone.

4. Make friends. I can''t emphasise it enough. 

Surviving alone is difficult. Growing alone is almost impossible.

Find people with similar interests, make friends, offer value first before expecting a favour. 

I have done more than millions worth of transactions just with people who met in CT. 

They would leave everything for me at any moment and fly out to help me. That is, priceless.

5. Everything you need to learn about the market and trading is available on the interest, for free.

The reason you buy paid courses is because the free stuff seems boring and tedious. 

You want a quick fix to learn something, so you choose to spend your money, hoping it will cut down down the learning effort. It won''t.

6. It is your duty to call out the Scammers. You know who they are.

7. The aim to get rich is to spend as much time possible with your mum. 
Most other things don''t matter. 

The most magical ability that you can earn is to allow all the dreams your mum had as a little girl, to come true.

8. Paid shilling is pretty common in Crypto. 

I know this because I have worked with people who would pay 300 dollars to big Crypto accounts to shill garbage. 
This is completely known.

It''s your decision if you want to Risk your finances on people who will sell their reputation and soul for 300 dollars.

For those who want to learn trading Crypto, I highly recommend to go through the Index of my Bitcoin Trading Master-Class Mentorship.

It is free as I make in my free time. No false Promises or Clickbait, Only Actionable trading Methods.

Multi-Asset Capabilities on Bitcoin:  * The Taproot Assets protocol enables the issuance, management, and exploration of various assets, like stablecoins, on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a major step towards transforming Bitcoin from a single-asset network to a multi-asset network, which potentially broadens Bitcoin''s use cases.  . Forward Compatibility:  * The release begins forward compatibility, meaning future protocol updates won''t introduce breaking changes affecting assets issued on mainnet. This is crucial for developers and organizations as it provides a level of assurance and stability for building on this protocol.  . Support for On-chain and Future Lightning Network Functionality:  * Initially, the release supports on-chain functionalities with plans to integrate Lightning Network support. The Lightning Network is known for facilitating instant, low-fee transactions, which would significantly benefit asset transfers, especially in the context of global foreign exchange transactions.  . Response to Demand for Stablecoins:  * The demand for stablecoins is overwhelming, particularly in emerging markets where local currencies suffer from high inflation. By facilitating the issuance and management of stablecoins on Bitcoin''s infrastructure, Taproct Assets could help meet this demand, providing a potentially more stable and accessible financial medium to billions of individuals.  . Integration with Existing Bitcoin Infrastructure:  * Taproot Assets transactions on the Lightning Network will utilize existing Bitcoin liquidity, allowing seamless routing of transactions without nodes knowing they''re forwarding Taproot Assets transactions. This level of integration can strengthen Bitcoin’s network effects and security foundation.  . Developer-Friendly Tools and Community Engagement:  * The release includes developer-friendly tools and improvements based on feedback, indicating an active engagement with the developer community. The availability of these tools in popular developer platforms like Polar and litd vO12 can spur innovation and development of applications around multi-asset transactions on Bitcoin.  . Real-world Asset Experiments:  * Developers experimenting with real-world assets like gold and US Treasuries find Bitcoin''s global liquidity, decentralization, and security appealing. Taproot Assets provides a platform to bring these experiments to a mass market.  . Progress Towards a Multi-Asset Lightning Network:  * With the foundational features shipped, the focus shifts towards making Lightning a multi-asset network, which could redefine global money flows and leverage existing network effects of the Lightning Network.  . Economic Impact:  * By potentially bitcoinizing the dollar and other financial assets, and facilitating instant  global transactions, this development has the potential to significantly impact global  economic structures.

1/ 📈 Immediate Surge: After recent publications, BTC experienced a sharp rise across trading platforms. On the Binance BTC/USDT market alone (accounting for 8% of BTC''s 24-hour volume), it jumped from $27.88k to $30k - that''s a 7% increase in just about 30 minutes!

2/ 🎯 Critical Milestone: The crypto market is hinged on BTC''s ability to breach and consistently maintain a value north of $28k.

3/ ⏳ Brief Touch: While this pivotal milestone was momentarily attained on futures, the spot market price peaked at $27.98k earlier today. It''s evident just how crucial this price point is in the larger scheme.

4/ 📌 Takeaway: The rapid movements and these price thresholds aren''t just numbers. They signify investor sentiment, market dynamics.

Keep an eye out for the 28k level.

Bitcoin is ~180 days away from its Bitcoin Halving

At this point in the cycle, Bitcoin retraced -25% in 2015/2016 and -38% in 2019

History suggests a retrace is possible

A -30% retrace from current prices would see Bitcoin drop to ~$20,000

As trad equities remain sluggish and Bitcoin continues pumping like mad, where do you think trad market investors'' attention will go?

That''s a 45 TRILLION dollar market in the US alone and a portion of that will find it''s way into the 1.3T crypto market, starting with the 700B marketcap King of them all- Bitcoin.

It''s a self-fulfilling, prophecy. 

As BTC outperforms the SPX, money and attention from trad markets will shift into BTC, leading it to outperform even more, leading more money and attention to flow to it, and the cycle repeats.

New all time highs are coming faster than you think and most are un-prepared/caught off guard- expecting another 6-12 months at these levels before they need to be paying attention.

🔶A glance at the daily shows a rally post breakout from the 200-day MA, now at approx. $33k. With $30k resistance shattered, signs point to bullish momentum. 

🔶However, a word of caution 🚫: RSI > 70% suggests the asset is overbought, hinting at potential short-term consolidation. 

Eyes on the $33k-$35k range.

🔸 Dominant bullish calls in options open interest
🔸 Soaring open interest at $8.8 billion
🔸 Strong indicators favoring long traders
🔸 Key focus: Maintain support at $34k and aim for open interest to surpass 100,000

🎯Conclusion:
While BTC currently faces resistance at $34K. Expect potential volatility, with chances of a swift uptrend or a brief consolidation between $32K and $35K.

5 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving period

Approximately 5.5 months remain until the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024

Historically, any deeper retraces that occur during this period tend to generate fantastic Return On Investment for investors in the several months after the Halving 

2. Pre-Halving rally

Then ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

In anticipation of the Halving, investors "Buy the Hype" in an effort to "Sell the News"

3. Pre-Halving retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur around the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep

This Pre-Halving retrace makes investors question whether the Halving was a bullish catalyst on price after all

4. Re-Accumulation

The Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

5. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new All Time Highs

Use this for daily reference. Include VWAP as your average tool. https://t.co/fy4b9kB6nJ', '1636020589981843464.jpg', '© t.me/EmperorbtcTa w) @EmperorBTC  What is the VWAP?  The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading indicator that shows the average price of a security, adjusted for its volume. VWAP is calculated by multiplying typical price by volume and dividing by the total volume. A simple moving average incorporates price and time but not volume.  VWAP features:  -It appears as a single line on intraday charts.  -All intraday traders use the VWAP to assist them in determining intraday price trends.  -VWAP has bands as well which can be used as analogous of Value Area High and Low for volume profile  Types of VWAP:  1. Session VWAP  2. Anchored VWAP  Typical Price: (H+L+C)/3  Volume= No, of contracts traded  When to use VWAP?

For a VWAP sloping up, try to long the first or second retest  During consolidation periods, the price will just chop around the VWAP in a tight range. The VWAP here is not indicating where big orders moved price but simply becomes the mid-point of a tight  This is an example of a fiat VWAP, it is best not to overanalyse and just long/short existing levels till they fail. Grid bot trading is also recommended in these conditions. The reason you can long-range low/short-range high without overanalysing these ranges is because when the VWAP is flat, the price always retums back to the VWAP (around mid-range) if it gets too far away.  Anchored VWAP  There are two scenarios when the anchored VWAP proves most useful:  1 - As we have mentioned before, when the normal VWAP is flat, price continues to move in a range and using the normal VWAP does not offer us any great entries. Thus, we make use of it in the following way:  First, we placa the anchored VWAP at a point where a consolidation range starts to form while the normal VWAP is fat.  Larger ange Migs  Next, we can use this as a dynamic range to short the range high/longthe range low within a larger range formed.

Last week, we had entered a long below 26.5K.

Many were calling for 23K but as we discussed, it was a crowded Play. 

Important to take a cautious approach right now as most traders were not positioned properly and would like to get in on any breakouts.

This is why we are taking a clean HTF chart, Monday''s high will be key this week in My opinion, so it''s better to wait for it in case you are not already positioned.

1. We closed September green and in amazing fashion. Really nice monthly close but just below the crucial $27.3k level.

2. Important daily and weekly level which was our range high for past few weeks. We had a really powerful break out from this level and bulls would like to see this level hold at all costs.

3. nPOC from August 17 (the day when we had one of the most significant drops in BTC in 2023, that too without any big news) is just above us. We have not tagged the level yet but it will be crucial right now as we saw some spot takers step up when price reached this level.

Spot CVD increased with price but Perp CVD was flat when we first approached the nPOC. This is good as even the pump above the daily level saw an OI collapse wiping out an insane amount of shorts with some spot bid that had been lacking the last time we tried to break out of level at point 2.

4. OI has again rebounded quickly with negative funding. There has been an increase of around $800 million in aggregate OI since the pump, so there is a chance of increased volatility.

Conclusion: 

I am not a breakout trader for the most part. Post-pump is when you take profits on longs, not enter them. Best to wait and watch now.

Bears want to see a rejection from the nPOC or an early Monday High sweep after the day closes.

Bulls want to see Daily level and Monthly open defended at all costs but more importantly, daily closes above $28.2k levels for some more momentum.

I will be taking a long if we lose 28K levels and Bullish Retest, any level below that, a full retrace will make all this Bull Pump, useless.

Are we bullish or will the recession send us back to our grandma''s house ang beg her for milk and bread?

Let us analyse.

ON-CHAIN SCRUTINY 

Crypto volatility continues to remain low. 
BTC trade volumes on Binance are down 48% in Sept, the second-largest monthly decline since April.

Both drops coincided with the removal of zero fees for the largest BTC trading pairs. This also goes to show how the current market is a PvP market and there is no new money coming in on Bitcoin at least.

However, I''ve always noticed a pattern of how extremely low liquidity scenarios allow for lead to high volatility events which then lead to a strong comeback of volatility.

Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio Surging.

Seeing some déjà vu here. The Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio''s movement is giving me January vibes. After the initial shock, we''re seeing a steady rise in the Taker Buy ratio. Those yellow box sparks? They''re back.

While the current phase is stretching out a bit longer and prices are in a holding pattern, the upward trend in the Taker Buy ratio is clear. 

We''ve got those occasional sparks and some solid moves this week. This abnormal push taker buy volumes is mostly seen as a rise in retail apeing across a wide variety of coins.

If you''ve paid attention, you''ve seen some lower caps pump hard as BTC moves slightly higher over this week despite SPX bleeding like there''s no tomorrow. Also important to note that we''ll likely close a green September now which is very rare and has always resulted in Uptober.

Now talking about macro liquidity context. TradFi liquidity has made a comeback and I believe we see a resurgence in crypto as well, with the Ether futures ETF being one of the main narratives. 

Reserve Balances are another measure of liquidity. This has increased since the beginning of the year and will continue to do so IMO. This is still far off from 2021 highs but has retested 2020 liquidity boom levels of support.

Moreover, this has increased prior to stock market booms and close to Fed pauses since 1985.

I always look at energy fair value and cost of production. Energy fair value takes in metrics like lost Bitcoin, and consumption for various purposes while production cost is the average costs that miner incur to mine Bitcoin.

Post ETF valuations are something worth speculating over. If you think about metrics that would be attractive to tradFi investors, these would be one of them. Reasoning, what did Blackrock use as a proxy for Bitcoin investment until ETF approval? Mining stocks and energy companies that work with mining companies.

Volatility metrics that we discussed above anticipate volatility kicking in earlier than most expect (late 2023). This aligns with Bloomberg estimates for the launch of the ETF which could be the most positive catalyst for crypto since Tesla invested in Bitcoin.

*NOTE: Some fair value estimates are around $34.5k for Bitcoin which is again much higher from current prices.

Current Market Situation:

We reached our daily level from yesterday''s price analysis. We are above Wednesday High and Monday High and holding strong.

$26855 is our LTF support, if we hold through here, I would expect some continuation upwards. This is the level where spot selling stopped price from going up today and then later this was turned to support when spot showed some strength causing a decent number of short liquidations.

Like it has been for 1 week now, bias remains up, levels marked, no new positions up here as we are already long from yesterday and from much lower.

HTF outlook: Does not look as bad as CT would have you believe.

Ethereum is at a crucial point where it''s testing the close of the August 17th candle. It is up 10% from recent lows and yesterday it had a bullish candle that retraced more than 1 week of bearish price action

If at all we get 18-22K, I will bet my networth on it again and hold for 3 years. Thanks for reading.

We have a seemingly relentless spot bid here, approximately 700M $''s of $BTC market bought in this small range. Meanwhile, price isn''t making much headway- so we have passive sellers capping price atm. 

The question is simply who runs out of ammo first? Passive sellers or active buyers?

Note that OI is flat here- this is a battle between spot buyers and sellers with levered players sitting on the sidelines and watching the action. 

Funding is relatively low.

Overall, this looks healthy, and if the active buying persists I think passive sellers get blown out here with a multi-thousand dollar move to the upside.

On the other hand- if sellers maintain control and we do get a dip- don''t expect it to be anything crazy as with a lack of OI there isn''t much leverage to liquidate on the downside. 

In other words, number go up sooner or later and dips are for buying.', '1766002260587200587.jpg', 'QercusD1 @ 15m ff, Indicators Export CSV Toggle Indicator Labels SwopChart Type Sync WithToble CO MAIN-OLFU. ~ 3} 0) 6) Symbol Search I BTCUSDT - Binance-Futures 067445.7 H67445.3 L67346,1 C67445.2 Volume SMA9 586,03  ] te velba mero ibe che oe ae ee Vy Me err nuewnine insinuate innit chestnndbeish enon <Velo> Aggregated Open interest Coins Condles © 165.448K 165.532K 165.284K 165,448K  ae a  ON Wr see ea ail we et  & ©F SD O% OM EGAMN-  <Velo> Aggregated Volume Coins Cunmiative Delta @ -4.714K 0 @ & @  <Velo> Aggregated Spot Volume Coins Cumulative Dette. @ 27.403K 0.2.0 2 = eee emai coe  lili el hin i ana  ', '', False, NULL, False, 385947, 1352, 111, 117, 395272, 10975.91, 7.68), (19449, '2024-03-12 05:38:59.000000', 1767425030286188785, 'CredibleCrypto', 944746889194364928, 'twitter', 'Still in the position on $XRP from below and just added on to it for a third time, averaging up.

No moves without a counter-move. And a counter-move seems to be near.

We observe Negative Divergence - as BTC has rallied into its highs in a 3-wave structure (a B-wave). Sentiment is hot at 89!

4 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving Rally

Approximately 35 days remain until the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024

And ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

History has repeated in this respect

Now, Bitcoin is slightly more halfway through its Pre-Halving Rally phase

Even so, Bitcoin has performed a historic, never-before-done feat in its price action in the Pre-Halving period...

It has broken to new All Time Highs

This Pre-Halving Rally phase has thus been extensive

However technically, the next step is a Pre-Halving Retrace

Historically, in anticipation of the Halving, investors "Buy the Hype" in an effort to "Sell the News"

Short-term traders and speculators "Buy The Hype" several weeks before the Halving in anticipation of making a profit from this hype-fuelled rally

Then these speculators "Sell The News" to realise that profit, contributing to a Pre-Halving retrace which occurs only a handful of weeks before the Halving event itself

2. Final Pre-Halving Retrace

After the Pre-Halving Rally has concluded...

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur a few weeks before the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep

This Pre-Halving retrace can last multiple weeks and up to 77 days

This year, Bitcoin has experienced a -18% pullback in January and a -14% this early March

Therefore it''s possible a Pre-Halving Retrace, should one occur, would more likely be on the shallower side than on the deeper side

Also, this Pre-Halving Retrace could also be much shorter than has otherwise been the case historically

3. Re-Accumulation

The Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)

This period can last up to 150 days (i.e 5 months)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

However, in this cycle it would be the very first time that this Re-Accumulation Range develops the New All Time High area

As a result, this Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation 

4. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend

Historically, this phase has lasted just over a year (~385 days) however with a potential Accelerated Cycle occurring right now, this figure may get cut in half in this market cycle

Bitcoin rejects from the Range High of its current ReAccumulation Range

It''s clear that BTC is only one Weekly Close above the Range High away from entering the Parabolic Phase of the cycle

But history suggests this historic breakout is still several weeks away

Currently, expect BTC to range between $64k and $72k, giving altcoins a chance to shine. The $72k-$74k range is marked by high supply and selling pressure.

When we break from this pattern there is no doubt in my mind that the subsequent expansion will take us to new all time highs. 

For now, we just need to be a little more patient as while $BTC has the spotlight and is on its way to new all time highs most alts (like $HBAR) will likely continue to chop about for a bit longer.

People of different ages, risk appetites, responsibilities, incomes, and so on all have radically different needs and preferences. Add time frames into the mix and it becomes very difficult to offer any general principles.  But we''ll try something short and sweet. Try the following:  Liquid Spot Fund (50-90%). Long term positions with quarterly or half-year rebalancing. High cap, multi-month, core cyclical positions (e.g. BTC, ETH). Most of these positions should be accumulated during large dips and/or low volatility as much as possible. Potentially added to on very important high time frame breakouts. 50% is very aggressive, 90% is very conservative.  Trading, Altcoins, Rotation Fund (remainder %). If you’re a good trader, this will be a larger part of your portfolio. If you’re not so good, it''ll be something closer to the Ape Fund. This is for your short-term trading, day trading, perps, swing trades, rotations, and all that stuff.  Ape Fund (1-5%). Super speculative stuff. Illiquid dogshit memecoin tokens and NF Ts. Dodgy airdrops, staking, mints, hacked celebrity ticker shills, all of that.  Crucially: as a conservative starting point, the flow of funds should only go one way i.e. Ape Fund — Trading Fund > Liquid Spot Fund, not the other way around.  This makes sure that you''re not suddenly all in Ape Fund shitcoins that get rugged and don’t have any core positions if the market moves massively without you. It also ensures that you’re not funding your bad or losing trade habits with your ‘safer’ or lower risk positions.  Naturally, if you’re indeed a good trader or Ape Fund manager, those parts of your portfolio should increase on their own and ‘running it back’ after taking profit and moving it to your Liquid Spot Fund is pretty normal practice in crypto e.g. having an upper limit for money left on a CEX, and anything above that gets withdrawn.  Lastly, the sorely missing category is cash.  This is a really tough one because crypto traders like to go through extremes i.e. fully stabled up or fully deployed, and not much in between. So this more or less assumes your risk appetite is inclined towards the latter.  Generally, even in a fully deployed mindset, it’s smart to keep at least some % of profits in cash for at least two reasons: first, to make some actual real world money + cover tax liabilities, and second, to be able to buy mispricings if there’s a severe deleveraging event.  Books have been written on portfolio theory and stuff, so naturplly this is very limited, imprecise, and incomplete.  It''s just something to get the brain juices flowing.

2. Any pullbacks till the 4H level and nPOC around $44.5k is very important. Any entry triggers here can be a good long opportunity.

This region also had decent volume on the way up.

Why?...

✅ Perspective: BTC struggles during rate climbs like in 2021-22. During rate declines, BTC performs good.

✅ Correlation Matters: BTC has strong positive correlation to US Bonds (value, not yields)

✅ Swissblock rate model forsees major crash in rates ahead and rally in US Bonds. How will it impact BTC this time around?

We see strong rally beginning soon.

Where to allocate our hard-earned funds?

Few months ago, we asked "Are we here". Now the evidence is piling up. Gold-BTC ratio has taken off. The technical indicators support the move,

We may see that the Ratio hit levels >100 which means 1 BTC will be valued 100 times more than 1 ounce of Gold.

Major Risk-On move may be coming!

5 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving period

Approximately 5 months remain until the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024

Historically, any deeper retraces that occur during this period tend to generate fantastic Return On Investment for investors in the several months after the Halving

2. Pre-Halving rally

Then ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

In anticipation of the Halving, investors "Buy the Hype" in an effort to "Sell the News"

3. Pre-Halving retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur around the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep

This Pre-Halving retrace makes investors question whether the Halving was a bullish catalyst on price after all

4. Re-Accumulation

The Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

5. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new All Time Highs

If 2016 history repeats - Bitcoin will probably continues sideways until two months before the Halving

If 2019 history repeat - Bitcoin could see one final deeper retracement going into the Halving 2024

If we look at the structure of BTC, it now seems like we have a Major Bull Flag in play. And in fact, we may have seen the bottom of the final move lower.

There is still a Risk, that we could see another strong sell-off before BTC moves higher towards ATH. 
That risk will be eliminated as price moves above 71K.

3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace

Bitcoin has produced two -18% retraces prior to the Halving in the span of just over a month

In mid-March, BTC pulled back -18% before recovering to $70000 and now in mid-April BTC has retraced -18% again

This downside is typical just before the Halving

In 2016, the Pre-Halving Retrace was -38% deep and in 2020 it was -19% deep

Nonetheless, this Pre-Halving Retrace represents the final bargain-buying opportunity in the Pre-Halving period

Bitcoin is only 2 days away from the Halving

2. Re-Accumulation

Now that the Pre-Halving Retrace is still in progress, it is seting up the very foundations of the Re-Accumulation Range

This Re-Accumulation Range develops a few weeks before the Halving and concludes with a breakout from it multiple weeks after the Halving

The goal now is for Bitcoin to a) establish firmly its Range Low of the Re-Accumulation Range and then b) move sideways going into the Halving and beyond

The Re-Accumulation phase can last multiple weeks and even up to 150 days (i.e 5 months)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

3. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace

The Pre-Halving Retrace has already occurred and is in the books

This Pre-Halving Retrace was -18% deep whereas in 2016 it was -38% and in 2020 it was -19% deep

This Pre-Halving Retrace was the final bargain-buying opportunity in the Pre-Halving period

Bitcoin is only 7 days away from the Halving

2. Re-Accumulation

Now that the Pre-Halving Retrace has occurred, it has set up the very foundations of the Re-Accumulation Range

This Re-Accumulation Range develops a few weeks before the Halving and concludes with a breakout from it weeks after the Halving

The goal now is for Bitcoin to move sideways going into the Halving and beyond

The Re-Accumulation phase can last multiple weeks and even up to 150 days (i.e 5 months)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

3. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend

Historically, this phase has lasted just over a year (~385 days) however with a potential Accelerated Cycle occurring right now, this figure may get cut in half in this market cycle

As is historically the case, Bitcoin is developing a clear Re-Accumulation Range going into the Halving

This is the range Bitcoin would likely breakout from weeks after the Halving

A pullback here will affect ALTS. How you may ask? Read on young degen...

Every alt is different. Some currently sitting on major support, others are up against significant resistance. On this pullback/consolidation if/when we get it, expect those alts that sit on HTF support and or are in generally bullish consolidations to take advantage of the sideways/chop on BTC to potentially make some moves to the upside. Meanwhile, expect alts that are at resistance to fall along with BTC and get drained during BTC''s consolidation- sacrificing their (short term) lives and energy for the greater good that is King Bitcoin. 

Once BTC completes its next low timeframe consolidation phase/correction, expect it to once again take the spotlight and send BTC dominance to new local highs as it continues its path to the promised land.

Analyzing our Swissblock signals, it''s evident that 30k is a crucial psychological level with some (not strong) support.

🔍 Delving deeper into current support levels, we might revisit 27k, potentially retesting the bull flag.

⚠️ Below 27k, there is a gap in the market as our signals show low on-chain and trading volumes.

2. Invested in a Crypto Ponzi Scheme knowing it''s Ponzi Scheme, lost 300K. No Salvage.

3. Lost 80% of my Portfolio on 29th November 2017 Trading BTC in High Volatility. Was all in in one trade. No risk management. System froze for 15 seconds, I couldn''t exit. 

4. Lost 400K leverage Trading Matic. Wasn''t at the screen and it Dumped 15% on Leverage. 

5. Sent 10K to a CT account who kept begging for Funding Money. This was Dumb on my side because I showed Pity to someone Begging. He wouldn''t stop begging and I felt sad for him. 

6. Lost Wallet Keys 2-3 Times in 2017-18. Lost about 2-3 Bitcoin like this.

7. Used a Scam wallet for Ethereum in 2018 for Arbitrage. The Transaction never went through. Wallet stole everything. Lost around 15 ETH like this.

The current structure is identical to the one we saw on $BTC at 16-18k prior to a 60-day rally to ~60k.

Fractals aren''t guarantees of anything- but they often repeat when the goal and technical context is the same.

In this case, both of these structures are primarily sideways, ranging structures occurring after a clean/clear impulse (uptrend) and near vertical rally off a major low- which makes me believe that the goal here is re-accumulation- and so technical context is the same.

In both cases, no significant HTF market structure has yet been broken.

In both cases, many are calling for much lower.

A breakout from the accumulation range last time ignited the next leg up which sent Bitcoin up 200% in 2 months.

A 120% rally after breakout of this accumulation range is all we need to hit new all time highs, and this time, we have twice as much time (4 months) to do it in 2023.

So do I think we can still make new ATH this year for Bitcoin? Absolutely. This fractal is obviously not the sole reason I believe this to be the case, but it''s another perspective if you are struggling with my other arguments for new highs which have been covered extensively on Twitter already.

Invalidation of this idea (the repeating fractal/break in market structure) is at 24.8k, the same level I''ve been referring to for months.

If 24.8k is breached, we can eye up lower targets and re-assess, until then there is no reason to go max bearish at what is, arguably, a point of maximum opportunity and risk/reward with clear invalidation.', '1692999829381644787.jpg', 'CrecibleCrypte published on TradingViemcom, Aug 19, 2023 20:01 UTC  Bitcoln / U.S. Dollar lecex, 1, BITMEX 026049.95 12625704 125795.56 C26136.13 +8618 (+0.33%) 272 bars, 272d uso BTC AT 16-18K PRIOR TO 3 MONTH RALLY TO GOK+  60000.00  MID IMPULSE/UPTREND RE-ACCUMULATION STRUCTURE  66000.00  52000.00  50000.00  highs fer Sshicokacinaed 48000.00  46000,00  44090.00  42000.00  9 ano  38000,00  6. continuation ,  2. ows taken eee)  34900.00  4. highs taken 32600.00  br} 31000.00  2900.00  28:200.00  l dee s¥  27100.00  1. lows formed  §. higher low?  24700.00 i q 3. lows taken  23500,00. 22500.00 21890.00 ft i 2070.00, 19900.00 49100.00 18300,00 17600.00 16900.00 16200.00 18600.00  15000.00 272 bars, 272d  May jun ut Ag Sep Oct Now Dec 2023 Feb Mar Apr May dun tot Aug Sep Oct Nav Dec 2024 Feb  ‘TE Tradingview ', '', False, NULL, False, 418785, 1201, 220, 150, 395268, 11605.82, 7.76), (16068, '2023-08-17 23:09:38.000000', 1692312762519601325, 'CredibleCrypto', 944746889194364928, 'twitter', 'Literally took more liquidations than we got during the FTX collapse to flush us this low and we couldn''t even break HTF bullish market structure.

The funding rate is the cost of holding an open position in a perpetual swap contract (perp).

It is usually calculated by the difference between the [price of the perpetual swap contract] and [price of a spot-based index].

If funding is positive, the perp price is trading at a premium (above) the index price. Open long positions pay funding, open short positions receive funding.

If funding is negative, the perp price is trading at a discount (below) the index price. Open short positions pay funding, open long positions receive funding.

Perps are different to standard futures contracts because there is no expiry or rollover mechanism. 

This begs the question: how and why do perps generally trade in line with spot markets?

Answer: Funding.

This is a built-in arbitrage mechanism designed to incentivise traders to keep these instruments (specifically their prices) in line with one another.

For example: Perp trading meaningfully above the spot index price --> funding rate goes up.

Two things happen:

1. It becomes more expensive for long holders to keep their positions open (negative incentive).

2. Traders can buy spot, sell the perp, and collect the funding rate with minimal directional exposure (positive incentive).

The bigger the difference between the perp price and the spot price, the higher the funding rate.

Think of this as providing greater incentives to arb the difference the more out of line these instruments get from each other.

To be crystal clear, funding is primarily a product of the difference between [perp price] and [spot-based index price].

I''ll also reiterate an important point from an earlier tweet: if funding is at baseline and/or there is no interesting divergence forming between price, funding, and time - you are unlikely to find an attractive setup.

All of these tools become complementary and contextually interesting when "something doesn''t add up" or if they''re at/near a relative extreme.

From a trading perspective, identifying divergences between funding and price can lead you closer to productive trade ideas:

1. Example: High positive funding but price is moving lower or stalling/not moving higher.
1.1. Reasonable inference: Perp longs are aggressive but are not being rewarded for it. This is potentially bearish (especially if other contextual clues present e.g. price into key resistance).

2. Example: High negative funding but price is moving higher or stalling/not moving lower.
2.1. Reasonable inference: Perp shorts are aggressive but are not being rewarded for it. This is potentially bullish (especially if other contextual clues present e.g. price into key support).

3. Example: Funding becoming more positive as price is moving lower.
3.1. Reasonable inference: Perp dip buyers are in ''disbelief'' fading the move AND/OR spot traders are the aggressive sellers. This is potentially bearish (especially if other contextual clues present e.g. perp OI increasing, spot volumes and CVD leading, et cetera).

4. Example: Funding becoming more negative as price is moving higher.
4.1. Reasonable inference: Perp sellers are in ''disbelief'' fading the move AND/OR spot traders are the aggressive buyers (especially if other contextual clues present e.g. perp OI increasing, spot volumes and CVD leading, et cetera).

These are just a few basic ones and you can build more setups especially if you incorporate OI + CVD where appropriate.

In essence, we''re circling back to very important first principles here:

1. Who (if anyone) is being aggressive?
2. Is their aggression being rewarded?

As a final note, it''s also important to understand not only what the funding rates are and their implications, but also how they came to be.

I can think of three particular examples where funding rates are misinterpreted most frequently.

1. Negative funding after an outsized move with liquidations.

As discussed, funding reflects the difference between the perp price and the index price.

Perps have higher leverage than the spot-based assets that typically make up the index. As a result, when there''s a large amount of liquidations in the perp, those liquidations and messy unwinds exacerbate the size of the move.

Perps typically become more dislocated than spot at extremes, so naturally they end up trading at a discount to the index.

Accordingly, the negative funding after a wipeout does not necessarily mean that the market is short from the bottom now. It''s just a reflection of perps getting hammered harder than spot because of the leverage that they offer.

2. "Spot premium".

Spot premium - where spot price of an asset is trading consistently higher than the perp or future price of an asset - can provide useful signals.

For example, during the 2021 bull run it was common to see spot exchanges like Coinbase consistently trading at a premium to perps and futures during the U.S. session.

One could reasonably see this as a reflection of risk appetite and more aggressive buyers in the spot market, which is generally a good sign.

However, this same argument was made many times on the way down from circa ~50k BTC - and it didn''t quite work out.

Mechanistically, spot was leading the selling --> perps would follow --> perps get liquidated and move more aggressively than spot --> perps end up below spot --> "spot premium".

It''s the same spot premium in form but completely different in substance and context.

If you will be relying on spot premium as an argument for spot demand, make sure that you have other arguments for there being demand in the market (not just the funding rate or basis).

3. Dodgy outlier altcoin (max) funding = squeeze imminent.

Particularly pertinent pattern in the second half of 2023.

It goes something like: huge price increase --> hugely negative funding --> speculators pile in the long side for continuation/short squeeze on account of the negative funding rate --> spot gets mega dumped instead and funding normalises.

For the outlier lower caps specifically, I''d be sceptical about looking into funding-oriented stuff too closely as it tends to be ''gamed'' more often than not. The signals tend to be clearer on more liquid, higher cap assets.

More broadly, funding alone does not always make for a compelling argument for a squeeze.

You need to first build a prima facie credible case that the aggressors are the ones offside, ideally with some confluence via OI.

Even then, positive funding can normalise by perps closing/spot buying and negative funding can normalise by perps buying/spot selling - without any dramatic squeeze.

There are a lot of other interesting things about funding rates, but this is already quite long for an ''introductory'' post.

Hope you enjoyed this one.

Our shorts from 28-29k have already made a lot of profit.

After one of the largest liquidation events ever, it''s important to play it level to level.

Most important levels:

1. There is a confluence of VaH of current swing + fibonacci level + Important Higher time frame level on Daily.

If we reclaim this level then it could be bullish, but if we fail to reclaim or have a lower time frame sweep and rejection, that would be a high conviction short with good confluence.

Orderflow data shows that there was strong market selling here on perps after we broke down from the daily level at 28555 and it kept going till this level.

2. Current area of interest for longs. 
I am not counting the current wick when playing level to level, the reasoning is that there was no volume there and it was probably because someone on Coinbase had a huge margin call. 

At least in the short term, I expect all traders to wait for that wick ($24188) to get swept and for it to be defended by spot bids and never get run.

Sweep and reclaim for Daily Level ($25.3k) is good for a long. If we break down from here convincingly then it''s lights out.

BEST WAY TO TRADE RIGHT NOW IS TO SCALP ON LTF.

My Directional Bias is to close the Shorts from 28K at 24K Levels and then reevaluate for Upside.

• Yes, inflation is high, but in my opinion (and I feel dirty saying it), the Fed has done an okay job of controlling it (albeit not in the best time or way).

•Inflation is slowing down in the US, the Fed is contemplating rate cuts, and the job market is resilient despite the worst sentiment. Not as many people are losing jobs as the Fed expected or wanted.

Trivia- 
People losing jobs = less money in the market = lower inflation. This sounds evil but that''s a tool the FED uses.

• Sure, the housing market will slow down. Homeowners with lower interest rates won''t move to a new house with a higher mortgage.

•Those who are currently renting will not look to buy a new house because of the high mortgage rates.

This doesn''t signal a crash to me, but rather a mechanism of lower demand, which is anti-inflationary.

If your Easily triggered dont read.

The crypto markets are the most savage representation of human nature that you can witness, the fact that it is disguised with memes and cute anime is a ruse, like the Venus fly trap for example the scent is tantalizing and alluring, but as soon  as you step in you get eaten alive. Knowing how to navigate this environment is essential for survival.

Align yourself with good people,  form a community of people that you would trust enough to have your back, research together as two brains are better than one.

Contrary to popular belief the next bull market will be driven by fundamentals, it''s no longer like the ICO days where you can throw a dart at any old crap and still make money  use tools like @tokenterminal to discover projects that matter.

If your not a data/computer scientist or dont understand tokenomics it''s not advisable to try to ape into low priced shit coins expecting them to reach billion dollar market caps, more often than not the claims of the projects are  deceitful and usually these projects are under capitilized to forfill promises they claim and end up being vaporware, sometimes it''s better to invest in projects with higher capitalization but with clear quantifiable metrics you can measure.

We are not in the correct part of the cycle to be longing most alts blindly and holding  them yet as they can drop more and under perform   the best time to long alts is when btc is at the tail end of the bull market cycle. Use bitcoin dominance to determine the most oppotunitic moment. BTC.D on tradingview.

You will see bullshit influncers posting onchain analytics about some unkown dude that turned 1k into 1m usd, yea if your a insider maybe, but most of the time it''s just so that you follow the wallet and ape into the next coin that pops up into wallet which then ends up being a honey pot or a scam, don''t fall victim to these lies, if your going to trade on chain smart money wallets invest into a tool like @nansen_ai or @cherrypick_xyz and do your own research, you chances of finding a better trade from this strategy will increase significantly.

Don''t trade from a place of desperation if you don''t have other forms of income, your emotional state will not allow you to make profit in that mindset, your better off getting a regular day job.

Don''t trust the media, don''t trust wannabe traders on CT trust only the data. Learn as much as you can. The best investment you can make during this time is on yourself, get better every.. fucking.. day.

Above all be ethical, Hold integrity dear to your heart as those who do are a rare breed in this space and it will make you an incredible asset and stand out from the sea of shite, shout out to @MMCrypto
And @CarlTheMoon11 and these other Muppets that was shillin bull flags to their millions of followers and getting them liquidated just so they can make money from ref links.

NINE DATA SETS YOU MUST KNOW.

We are at a sad phase in the cycle where people are debating if crypto gains will ever come back.

If 10x returns will ever be possible.
What does the data say when bias is removed.

Some Facts.

• Online Searches for Bitcoin and Crypto is at all time low. 
• Lowest volume in crypto ever seen along with lowest volatility.
• Most VCs are at intense losses and are now coping by shilling garbage meme coins.
• Making money in crypto right now has become a game of, "WHO CAN DUMP FASTER" with the meme coins (Unless you are a good BTC ETH trader)

Some more points to consider. 

1. Digital asset investment vehicles had an outflow of US$168 million in the second last week of August, the largest since March 2023. After Grayscale news, outflows stopped for Bitcoin and inflows started. Altcoins continued to see outflows after it became clear that it''ll take more time before ETFs are approved even after Grayscale win. Outflow shows taking off crypto from exchange and putting it in private wallets.(Pic below)

2. CryptoQuant have also reported that we just saw the highest Bitcoin fund daily volume since the beginning of the year on August 30th.

3. This is important! Bitcoin outflows consistently surpassed inflows by an 80% margin year-over-year. This is Bullish as larger players continue to move BTC to cold storage, these don''t care about 10-15% fluctuations, this shows confidence in BTC. HODL Waves data shows significant percentage of Bitcoin''s total supply is held in cold storage by long-term holders. ( See Pic Below)

A little biased conclusion from Points 1-3 
Some players, are taking coins off exchange and storing it offline.

Market Bottom Analysis:
4. Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) suggests Bitcoin might be near its market bottom, with values around 0.96 indicating investors selling at a loss.
(Pic Below)

5. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR) shows short-term holders are trading at a loss, a signal of market fear and potential market bottoms. 

Volume & Liquidity Analysis:

6. Centralized crypto exchanges recorded their lowest monthly trading volume since October 2020, at less than $423 billion. Altcoin spot volumes decreased as attention shifted towards a potential Bitcoin ETF.

Volatility

7. Move up since Grayscale news was news driven and on derivatives. No major action on spot right now. The derivatives market volume was 20 times the spot volume across major exchanges. This could also mean volatility will increase soon, but not immediately. More the derivatives market participation in comparison to spot -> More chances of volatility.

8. DVOL (Bitcoin historical volatility) is range-bound between 30-50. Demand for long-dated calls in options market has increased a lot. Currently the implied volatility is lower than historical volatility. Meaning options traders still expect lower volatility for longer. We don''t have a catalyst for now. IV (Implied Volatility) level continues to decline while last week 143k ETH options expired at put call ratio of 0.85 and max pain price of $1700. This is a good example of time capitulation in play right now.

9. BTC velocity continues to decrease, now sitting at 23, close to last huge low at 19.8. This shows how well Bitcoin is changing hands in the market. BTC forms a bottom when this metric bottoms and then increases with increase in volatility. (Pic Below)

In conclusion, the market is in a winter where the old guards withdraw their tokens and rest, the opportunists freeze and leave, the experienced will accumulate.
Whales are unbothered, having seen multiple cycles, the know we might even dump to 18K, but 70K is guaranteed in 2-3 years, and then, it won''t matter if you bought at 25K or 18K.

BTC dipped under $26k on Friday before the rally of this week, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell hints at potential interest rate hikes, adding pressure to crypto and stock markets.

BTC''s history shows that interest rates hold sway over investor sentiment. Higher rates push liquidity away from assets like BTC, while lower rates bolster optimism.

1. September tends to be a negative month for #BTC

Typically, we tend to see a negative month for BTC in September

However, for the most part BTC sees single-digit drawdown in Septembers

8 out of 10 of the past Septembers have experienced downside

Only 2 months saw small, single-digit gains in the month of September (+2% in 2015 and +6% in 2016)

2. Frequently occurring September retrace is -7%

The most recurring drawdown in September has been a -7% dip throughout the month

$BTC saw a -7% in September in 2017, 2020 and 2021

There was also a -5% dip in 2018 which comes close to the -7% mark

3. If double-digit drawdown occurs, it would likely be shallow

$BTC only saw double-digit retracement in 2019 (-13%) and in 2014 (-19% where price saw the worst-ever drawdown)

However, 2014 was a Bear Market year which applies less to 2023 given how 2023 is a Bottoming Out year similar to 2019 or even 2015

It''s thus better to compare 2023 with 2019

4. Chances for a massive crash are unlikely

In 2019 BTC saw a -13% retrace but we also need to keep in mind that BTC just saw one of its worst-ever August drawdowns at -16%

It''s unlikely that Bitcoin would experience severe back-to-back drawdown both in August and now in September as well

5. Likely retrace to be between -7% and -13%

I think a drawdown of around -7% to -10% September could reasonably occur from current levels

This would see price drop to between $22,500 and ~$24,000

I do still think that those lows (dotted red lines) may still be swiped but for now think some relief to local highs makes sense. 

As per my last update video if we pump past these local highs and to 45k+ then our bottom is likely in already.

For now, watching the highs at the dotted green lines.

Worth noting that the "Bitmex bidder" still has another 40-50M in bids in the teal box below- but I''m not so sure those bids will be filled.

This chart suggests, that the #SOLETH ratio could rise to ~0.76 from current level of ~0.14.

In other words, #SOL may outperform #ETH by 4-5X into the Crypto top. And Ethereum is going to rally by itself also.

5 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving period

Approximately 90 days remain until the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024

Historically, any deeper retraces that occur during this period tend to generate fantastic Return On Investment for investors in the several months after the Halving

This upcoming period will be crucial as any retrace during this period will likely represent the final bargain-buying opportunity for Bitcoin

Specifically, there is a 30-day window or so where a deeper retrace could occur, between now and the Pre-Halving rally which we''ll discuss next

2. Pre-Halving rally

Then ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

In anticipation of the Halving, investors "Buy the Hype" in an effort to "Sell the News"

Short-term traders and speculators "Buy The Hype" several weeks before the Halving in anticipation of making a profit from this hype-fuelled rally

Then these speculators "Sell The News" to realise that profit, contributing to a Pre-Halving retrace which occurs only a handful of weeks before the Halving event itself

3. Pre-Halving retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur around the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep

This Pre-Halving retrace can last multiple weeks, making investors question whether the Halving was a bullish catalyst on price after all

4. Re-Accumulation

The Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

5. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new All Time Highs

Historically, Bitcoin tends to perform its Pre-Halving rally ~60 days before the Halving (light blue)

Which means...  

If $BTC is going to perform a deeper retrace during its Pre-Halving period (orange), it should occur over the next 30 days or so

Is this going to be the first time ever that Bitcoin breaks beyond this Macro Diagonal resistance in the Pre-Halving period?

Historically, successful retests of this resistance tend to occur Post-Halving

A Monthly Close beyond the resistance would confirm the breakout of course

Don''t look for large pullbacks to buy

If the move is legit, it shouldn''t immediately* retrace a big chunk - if it does, that''s a sign of weakness

Instead, priority should be shallow pullbacks and/or low time frame entries.

It''s counterintuitive, but if you think it through:

1. The breakout is a sign of strength
2. I will wait for a large pullback to buy

If (2) plays out, then (1) is less likely to be true - you''re contradicting your own trade idea.

*The "immediately" part is important - buying large pullbacks to levels once the market has cleared them and has spent some time away from them is very reasonable. On the other hand, buying large pullbacks to levels immediately post-breakout increases the likelihood that you''re buying a failed breakout.

TLDR: If you''re trying to get an entry to a strong market post-breakout, play closer to the market with tight invalidations, or not at all.

The appeal is simple: they are fun, there’s no fake tech sophistication, and they are a natural response to the low float/high FDV opaque insider unlock VC coin meta.

In the past we had to wait for CEX listings for something to really gain mindshare and become attractive to trade, but now there are a ton of ways to trade entirely new stuff on-chain (and this is becoming even more frictionless).

Altcoins have always been about flow, liquidity, and momentum (and derivatives therefrom i.e. volume, mindshare, and so on). This may seem like a reductionist take, but it follows from the facts that: 

1. If crypto turns cyclically bearish, there have historically been no ‘safe havens’ or intracrypto hedges against downside. When stuff dies, correlations converge closer to 1 and everything dies together, irrespective of ‘good tech’ or ‘vapourware memecoin’. 

2. Even shiny stuff (SOLUNAVAX, FOAN, DeFi 1.0 etc.) struggles to regain relevance after its time in the limelight and generally bleeds against BTC/ETH, and is even weaker against the even newer and shinier stuff. 

As a result, altcoin trading has always been more akin to a bank robbery: get in, take as much money as possible while conditions are good, get out, and don’t return to the crime scene or hit the same place twice. 

It logically follows that the ‘investment’ time horizon should be short, and loyalty (from a multi cycle perspective) should be close to 0. 

Thus far the winners have been memecoins. 

Maybe that’ll persist and the strong ones will keep being strong for the entire cycle. Maybe memecoins as a category will persist but the old guard becomes displaced. Who knows? 

The point is - it doesn’t matter. 

Altcoins have always been about short-term (or at most single cycle) attention grabs before everything dies and we reinvigorate the gambling spirit under a new guise. 

Memecoins are not a radical departure from that, just the most recent version.

Poor execution, dodgy rules, and no transparency.

Instead of keeping it at that and continuing my peaceful life of losing money trading Bitcoin perps once per year, I decided to help him build something alongside @abetrade and @unclesendit.

I believe we have good execution, fair rules, and full transparency.

This model is popular in FX but all the crypto versions sucked. 

I believe this one sucks less - our crypto liquidity comes from Bybit, not some opaque CFD or tradfi broker with spreads you could fit a truck through.

This industry gets a lot of justified criticism. We don''t shy away from that and address it directly. I recommend reading the Transparency page prior to purchasing an evaluation.

Despite the 4H timeframe indicating BTC is overbought. BTC''s upward trend may persist, intensifying investor FOMO across the board.

🔍 Technically, BTC navigates uncharted territory towards $46k. Expect volatile moves between $40k-$46k. The 20-day EMA provides a safety net for potential pullbacks, making shorting risky. Current patterns hint at a climb towards $45k.

💡 Conclusion: Stay alert, but optimistic. Yet the  BTC''s momentum suggests more upside. #CryptoInsights #HODL 🚀📌

Life is so easy when you follow price. 

Consolidation pattern: Ascending triangle

Price stays bullish above ascending trendline 
Current price: $27940 

Only flip short & hold till $27k ($25,2k if continuation) if close sub $27940 and S/R flip. That would be a pullback retest entry (bearish S/R flip entry)

Now that we are testing our first actual level of support to the downside you ARE allowed to get a LITTLE bullish. If we are going to go for the highs again, we should hold here. A few things to note:

1. The RED region above us is HTF resistance and weekly supply which, thus far, remains untested. It would be logical to test this region before a larger correction to 22-23k BTC occurs. This doesn''t mean it HAS to happen, but if we do rally from here back to the highs don''t flip mega bullish into resistance again. 

2. Check out the alts that held up well on this BTC drop. If $BTC holds here and IS headed back up to the highs, those alts should perform well to the upside as well. Two of my top picks atm, $HBAR and $TRAC, look primed to take advantage of a situation like this. Go check out the charts I''ve been sharing on them.

Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a significant rally towards the $52,000 level, breaking through key resistance areas. 

The $52,000 level is crucial, historically serving as strong resistance on the weekly chart. A breach could fuel further buying pressure, potentially leading to a FOMO scenario.

Now follow along and really understand what is being said here- the context is important to understand the logic presented with the chart at the end of this post.

I''ve already shown in prior posts how aggregate OI has played a significant role in local tops/bottoms over the last 12+ months- and logically, it makes sense why:

Long term spot holders continue to be net buyers of BTC, with the total amount of $BTC being HODL''d at all time highs and climbing. These holders aren''t very susceptible to price swings- they tend to accumulate in all market conditions at these prices- even adding to their stacks through the FTX collapse.

Meanwhile, most of the volatility on BTC over the last year has been driven by levered players and their liquidations- we know this because every significant top and bottom on $BTC over the last 12+ months has been marked by a significant top/bottom on OI (which is a measure of the number of leveraged contracts open in the market at any given time) and liquidations. 

Why is this the case? Well if spot holders are net buyers and not susceptible to sell their stacks during volatile price swings, then the ONLY way to get significant moves to the downside is via forced selling/liquidations of levered contracts, and the POTENTIAL for forced selling/liquidations can be measured by how high or low aggregate OI.

The HIGHER OI is, the more opportunity/potential there is for a large flush to the downside (because there are more "liquidation-susceptible" leveraged contracts open) and the LOWER OI is, the more difficult it will be to force price to the downside (because there are less "liquidation-susceptible" leveraged contracts open). 

So why is seeing 20k or below on $BTC here so improbable? 

If we take the below chart and look at the data we have we can see that aggregate OI at around 6B has proved to be a historical bottom (which has been steadfor the last 12+ months (marked by peak fear/panic at FTX collpase bottom) and around 11B has been a local top. 

Our last major flush that we had in August wiped out nearly 3B in OI (from 11B down to under 8B) but still failed to break our last major low at 24.8k. 

We now trade at nearly the same price as when that flush triggered, however, aggregate OI is now down from nearly 11B at the time of our flush in August to only 8.5B at this time.

Meaning we are now in the same spot we were before the flush to 25k BUT there are now ~50% LESS liquidation-prone levered positions in the system vs what there was in August. 

Even betting on a break of 24.8k is betting against the odds- as you would be looking for a move down of greater magnitude than the flush in August with HALF as much ammo (liquidation susceptible leveraged positions) available to cause that flush. 

To then call for prices of 20k and lower makes absolutely no sense to me- and I don''t see any logical argument based on the data we have to support a claim like that. For this to happen you would need either:

1. Unprecedented spot selling- the likes of which we haven''t seen in years- by a category of holders that are least susceptible to fluctuations in price.

2. Enough liquidations to fuel a break of the 6B OI level which has marked our bottom for over 12+ months including during peak fear/panic during the FTX collapse that marked our last major bottom at 15k. 

As usual, I''m always open for a respectful discussion with those that may challenge these views with logic, facts, and data of their own. So if you know some that are calling for 20k and below, tag them in the post below, as I''d love to see some hard data that supports the idea of a move back below these levels (lines pointing down don''t count) to challenge my own ideas.

Now that everyone is sure about a Bull run, let me tell you A Short Story about how I lost all my Networth, once.

On 29th November 2017, I was long BTC with all my net worth.

Expecting market to reach 10K.

The next second, I got completely liquidated as price Dumped.

Then my target of 10K was reached, AFTER liquidating me.

Moral - When Price run is about to begin, volatility makes sure to liquidate both Long and Shorts.
We careful with how much you''re risking, the leverage and stop loss. The market will go to prices you can''t imagine, in a second, in either direction.

Keep Safe, define your risk and know how much you are okay with losing.

I learnt from that mistake and then from the mistakes of others, accumulated the habit of not repeating mistakes.

1. We currently, are trying to break 30K, which was the bottom between May-June 2021, before the FED induced Money Printer rally.

2. I think right now we are in a confusion Phase. This is a Pre accumulation Phase.

3. Accumulation starts in the next 2-3 Months and then Heavy buying comes in after 3-4 months, after the FED starts cutting rates.

4. Housing market is getting expensive but this isn''t like 2008. The lending measures are a lot strict and the price rise is also due to supply shortage, unlike 2008.

5. So in conclusion. The fear of recession has done as much damage as Possible. 

Yes, BTC is at a resistance level, and a dump to 27-28K wouldn''t be surprising, although I''m not taking that trade.
Small dump, beats get too happy, fill more shorts and we keep going side ways, liquidate the Bears and keep Pumping.

We need some stimulus, ETF (Although I think it''s been talked about so much, a lot of it is priced in, but that doesn''t prevent it from being a stimulus)

FED rate cuts, end of war, anything.

📈 IBTC may soon be listed on #Nasdaq, as the application for listing was made in June.

🔍 Balchunas mentions, "This is the first spot ETF listed on DTCC, none of the others on there (yet). BlackRock leading these pre-launch logistics is a big sign. Approval seems imminent."

The current rally is lead by spot buying and long term holders are now offloading some of those bags. However, the market has been able to absorb that, this can be seen in the RHODL ratio which shows the realised price for HODLers being in an uptrend. Short term pullbacks after this occurs is common but this indicates a bullish cycle.  ¢ The BTC Supply in Profit indicator has increased by over 20 percent since the new year. This uptrend in the indicator has a 100% hit rate of price being higher one year from the signal. As always, it is better to average into the bottom than try and knife catch.  e Reserve Risk for BTC recently fell to its lowest level ever (lower than the 2019 or 2020 low), Indicates that the HODLer conviction is close to record highs. This is testament to the fact that the “crypto is dead” narrative that was common in previous bear markets is not in effect for this one.  * MVRV Z zcore for BTC moves above the consolidation zone. This indicator lags behind price but allows high conviction buys, it has moved above the consolidation zone which has historically occurred only at the end of bear markets. It can revisit this zone as it did in 2020 covid crash but this signals a good area for a long term buy.  FED NEWS  ¢ The Federal Reserve hiked its policy rate by 25 basis points for the 8th consecutive time in an effort to bring down inflation and attain a 2% target.  ¢ Rate Hikes will probably continue at a smaller pace. It''s too soon for the Fed to stop tightening, but if inflation data continues to show easing, the next 2-3 rate hikes should be enough to convince the Fed to pause.  ¢ The US labour market has increasing demand, defying expectations. In December, job vacancies reached 11 million and in January, unemployment rate was at 3.4% - a 53-year low. Wages are still growing, at a slower pace.  e The housing market in general and the residential construction sector specifically is currently in a downtrend. Single- family construction spending is declining while multi-family construction spending is still increasing.  MARKET CHATTER  ¢ Shoba Pillay, Celsius’ examiner calls Celsius’ operations a ponzi scheme. She was appointed by the US bankruptcy court and released a final report discussing the results of her examination of claims that Celsius’ business operations amounted to a Ponzi scheme.  « Alameda Research Sues Voyager For $445.8 Million of Loan Repayments. These loan repayments Alameda transferred to Voyager are originally funds Voyager lent to Alameda research before Voyager filed for its bankruptcy in July 2022.  ¢ Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade is set for March 2023. On February 1, Ethereum developers opened a new testnet called “Zhejiang” that gave users the first preview of what the withdrawal process will be like after the Shanghai upgrade.  PRICE UPDATE  © The trend since last week for dumps has been huge longs building on ByBit, open interest increasing with price being relatively stable and then puking those longs with a flash dump. A retrace to $21500 might take place if this continues.  « We have nPOCs above between $23300-$23400. A good setup would be to run local lows or long a Monday range low deviation into those levels.  « SPY is in a local uptrend. We might see upside targets of 4300 soon. While the market has seen volatility recently, the SPY is a trendy asset and is retesting a good flip zone of 4110 after breaking out.

Current price of $BTC is $70,000 & it''s about to have a having next week (BCH just had one). My claim is that price of #Bitcoin will rise but $BCH will fall in price to where its Mining will no longer be secure or sustainable & the centralized development team will "fork" BCH into Merge Mining with another token (probably Bitcoin) or convert code to something resembling Proof of Steak. OR there is a 3 Block Re-Org (aka double spend of last 3 blocks, would have offered more but you guys put in a 6 block cap 😂, take that out of the code and I will up my terms to a 6 block Re-org) 

So here are my terms:
* Time to win: 3 full Halving cycles from now since both tokens halved this month. (About 12 years max)
* Payout: If #BCH does NOT experience any of the above mining stability issues (what I call "mining death spiral in my videos - $doge had one hence its merge mined now) then I will will pay YOU $70,000 (current Bitcoin price). If BCH does experience a critical mining disruption that endangers its survival and has to implement a code change, YOU  and/or @rogerkver pay me 1 full #Bitcoin which today is worth $70k. Hence you can lock this Bitcoin up now and you won''t have to spend quarter Mil if say you lose the bet in 11 years (just under 3 halving cycles and Bitcoin is up to a few million each in price as BCH will not even keep up with $ inflation)

3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur a 28 to 14 days before the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep and lasted 3-4 days

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep and lasted 56 days (8 weeks)

Currently, $BTC is just over 14 days away from the Halving, pulled back -18% in total over the past couple of weeks

If the Pre-Halving Retrace bottom is in...

BTC therefore would''ve repeated a lot of qualities from the Pre-Halving Retrace of 2020

After all, the most recent retrace was -18% deep and lasted 7 days or so

However, Bitcoin in 2024 also repeated some 2016-like qualities as well

Because Bitcoin began its Pre-Halving Retrace ~30 days before the Halving whereas in 2016 Bitcoin began its retrace 28 days before the Halving

As a result, it looks like Bitcoin may be repeating pieces of both 2016 and 2020 Pre-Halving price tendencies

But the goal of a Pre-Halving Retrace is three-fold:

a) To offer one final bargain-buying opportunity in the Pre-Halving period

b) To form the Range Low of the future Re-Accumulation Range

c) To set up the next phase in the Bitcoin Halving Cycle: "Re-Accumulation" (red box)

With the latest rejection at ~$70,000...

It''s possible that we may now know where the Range High of the Re-Accumulation Range may be

As a result, it''s possible that this Pre-Halving Retrace period has already established the very beginnings of the Re-Accumulation phase

2. Re-Accumulation

The beginning of the "Re-Accumulation" phase occurs once the Pre-Halving Retrace has bottomed

In other words, the bottom of the Pre-Halving Retrace historically becomes the bottom of the Re-Accumulation Range (red)

It''s still uncertain if the Pre-Halving Retrace bottom is in

However, because a Pre-Halving Retrace has occurred already...

It is possible that Bitcoin is slowly transitioning away from its Pre-Halving Retrace phase into its "Re-Accumulation" phase (red)

The goal now is for Bitcoin to move sideways going into the Halving and beyond

The Re-Accumulation phase can last multiple weeks and even up to 150 days (i.e 5 months)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

However, in this cycle it is the very first time that this Re-Accumulation Range is developing around the New All Time High area

As a result, this Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range like we''ve seen throughout the cycle thus far and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation

3. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend

Historically, this phase has lasted just over a year (~385 days) however with a potential Accelerated Cycle occurring right now, this figure may get cut in half in this market cycle

Some qualifiers before the main content:

1. There''s never a good time to post this stuff. People love to infer that any post is some form of market commentary or hidden directional ''signal''. It is not, just take it for what it is.

2. There are no chart examples. Too much trading ''education'' is just cherry-picked charts with virtually no explanation. I''m at the other extreme; heavy on the substance but not gonna handhold you through hindsight examples. I trust/hope you can do that yourself if you really care. Or just watch TechnicalRoundup/my YouTube videos.

Right, onwards.

The specific goal of this post is to highlight how chart-oriented traders who are used to more ''orderly'' market conditions can adapt their tools and systems to participate in markets with stronger trends.

Crypto goes through phases of ''lockout trends'' where the market - especially altcoins - go up and keep going up without offering generic entries (also happens in the other direction but, erm, 4).

My definition of generic entries is entry techniques that are common in slower and/or rangebound markets: high(er) time frame failed breaks, sweeps/spikes, break-and-retest patterns, convenient candle closes at high time frame levels, and so on.

The aforementioned ''lockout trends'' are characterised by the absence of those generic entries. Specifically, the market will usually go up via some combination of: i) straight line move up; ii) impulse, consolidate, impulse, repeat; iii) impulse, diagonal grind up, impulse, repeat; and iv) impulse, shallow pullback, impulse, repeat.

In most of those cases, if you''re sat twiddling your thumbs on the daily/weekly/monthly time frames waiting for a textbook entry, you''ll be waiting for a while. In fact, in many cases, the high time frame ''obvious'' pullback only occurs much later when the trend is over, which is of little use to you.

This raises the following query: absent the textbook/generic high time frame price action entries, how can you adjust your approach to participate in a faster-moving environment?

I''m pulling this from a bunch of notes I made in 2018 (after 2017 uptrend) and early 2021, so the points are not in order.

If there''s at least one useful thing that helps, I''ll be satisfied.

1. Lower your time frames. There is no need to throw the baby out with the proverbial bathwater. If your trading system heavily relies on standard price action stuff (horizontal levels, ranges, failed breaks, sweeps/spikes, and so on) those tools are still viable. You just have to lower your time frames to adjust to trending conditions. If you''ve been using daily/weekly/monthly time frames and they just look like fat candles with 0 retracements, reduce your time frames to capture more intraday price action e.g. M5/M15/H1/H4. It''s still helpful to know where the high time frame levels are in case there''s a sharper flush etc. but generally post-breakout/breakdown and in between high time frame levels, the lower time frames are more useful.

2. Forget about macro retests in the medium-term. Big breakouts/breakdowns are a signal in and of themselves. It''s tempting to overlay a Babypipsesque view of the market and assume that a retest would provide a good entry, but more often than not, the opposite is true. Specifically, pulling back immediately after a large break ought to be treated with suspicion. If the breakout/breakdown is strong, it really shouldn''t look back or at the very least shouldn''t linger around the break level. There''s a pervasive fiction that a retest somehow ''confirms'' the break, but this is simply not true.

3. Post-break pullbacks must generally be shallow in a strong trend. This is a logical corollary of point (2) but worth stating on its own. Strong markets offer pullbacks, but they tend to be more shallow. A recurring pattern is the following: Breakout --> "I''ll buy the pullback" --> Market pulls back --> "Nah, bit more, the obvious HTF level is further away" --> Pullback ends --> Continuation. If the trend is strong, pullbacks will generally be shallow and not retrace all the way to the origin of the break. The only worthwhile exception to this is macro trend pullbacks e.g. the consistent 30-40% pullbacks in BTC during long uptrends, but even those don''t typically go all the way back to where the trend was formed. Practically, this means using closer and/or lower time frame levels of support on pullbacks to position for continuation.

4. Consolidations are a form of pullback. I''ve written and spoken about this extensively, so I will not labour the point here. As mentioned, strong markets will often avoid pulling all the way back to the origin of the break and instead trend via impulse --> consolidation --> impulse or some variant thereof. Therefore, consolidations are a form of pullback i.e. means of getting an entry. These consolidations are great for marking out lower time frame ranges (among other tools, to be discussed) and using them for entries.

5. Normally mediocre levels work better in a strong trend. Bit of an esoteric point, but if you''ve spent enough time squiggling on charts, you should intuitively know the difference between ''that level is a banger'' and ''mehh maybe it''ll react there but it''s a bit of a reach''. In a strong trend, the otherwise mediocre levels get a ''boost'' of sorts to their efficacy if they''re in line with the trend itself. In other words, meh support + strong uptrend = strong(er) support / meh resistance + strong downtrend = strong(er) resistance. One way to conceptualise this is that market participants have ''lower standards'' when they''re trend following.

6. Fast-moving MAs are very useful dynamic support/resistance levels. The exact MA configuration is less important. Binance default MAs, 13/21, 50/100/200, some sort of band/ribbon, Bollinger Bands, whatever. In ''lockout trends'' the market spends a lot of its time in the middle of nowhere (from a HTF S/R perspective) and as a result there is greater order herding around these uncontroversial ''consensus levels'' like MAs. Failed breakdowns at fast-moving LTF MAs and/or retests of slightly slower-moving MAs are solid areas to look for trend continuation.

7. LTF momentum resets and divergences are very useful entry techniques. Again, with lockout trends and in the absence of obvious HTF levels, the TA gets a lot looser. Especially if left curve tourists are aping the market, basic stuff works very well. Most momentum indicators/oscillators (RSI and others) generate ''reset'' signals e.g. RSI bouncing from/reclaiming 50 level. These can provide ''okay this has cooled off''-type entries even if the cooling off didn''t reach an obvious S/R level. The same applies to momentum divergences, ideally in line with the underlying trend e.g. LTF bullish divergence in uptrend/LTF bearish divergence in downtrend. Simplest of all, even basic overbought/oversold signals on lower time frames become surprisingly viable if the trend is strong enough. Note that these techniques aren''t mutually exclusive, I''d encourage you to look for confluence where appropriate. You can build a surprisingly robust LTF case for an entry based on MAs, momentum, LTF range etc. even if the HTF chart looks like it''s nowhere meaningful.

8. Liquidations are a valid form of pullback. This is the standard washout/flush trading trope. Basic premise is that aggressive punters trying to catch the trend have been forcibly removed from the market, and the dislocation caused by their liquidation(s) makes for a good entry. Specifically, you want to see sharp OI declines alongside sharp increases in liquidations that line up with the dominant trend i.e. long liqs in uptrend to provide a dip to buy/short liqs in downtrend to provide a rip to sell. This does work the other way around too but it requires some degree of chasing and it''s more nuanced. I will also note that exceptionally large liqs/OI wipeouts tend to be trend-reversing as opposed to a precursor to continuation, so ideally if you''re using liqs for continuation setups they should be noticeable but not some mega multi-month market-wide wipe if you''re trying to trend follow on lower time frames.

9. Price action pivots are your friends. Even if the HTF S/R levels are absent or of limited use, some standard price action concepts can still be very useful for ''grounding'' you or adding context. Specifically, in no particular order: Daily Open, Weekly Open, Previous Day''s High, Previous Day''s Low, Previous Week''s High, Previous Week''s Low. I have videos on all of those on the Cred YouTube channel, so I''ll spare you the repetition. They''re a good way to get something when the HTFs are showing nothing. And they work, because everyone is looking for something (recurring theme here).

10. Relative strength & relative pairs are always relevant. By relative strength, I mean how your coin is holding up relative to BTC/ETH as well as the broader market. It is generally easier and more fruitful to long the strong stuff until it stops being strong rather than trying to be ''early'' to the next narrative or longing the laggards hoping they stop lagging. This exercise is especially useful on down days - assess which coin(s) are down less than the others (or are perhaps even green) and you can infer with reasonable accuracy that strong coins during market weakness will be even stronger during market strength. As far as relative pairings, aside from making sure your assets are outperforming BTC/ETH, the ALT/BTC charts can provide contextual clues and offer S/R levels even if the ALT/USD chart is in the middle of nowhere. More colloquially, if you''re desperately trying to grasp at some S/R level but the USD pair is far away from anything meaningful, check the BTC pair. This can also apply to specific pairs e.g. SOL/ETH recently, but ALT/BTC is generally a good starting point given there is often more price history to work with.

11. Don''t ignore BTC/ETH. It is tempting to dispel the slow, boring, boomer coins from your watchlists if alts are trending and focus on the lower cap stuff instead. Even for pure altcoin punters, BTC/ETH are very useful tools. Not only for the reasons stated in (10), but also because the crypto market is still very tightly correlated for the most part. If BTC/ETH meaningfully pull back, there''s a good chance your altcoins pull back as well. Correlated pullbacks can provide clear, risk-defined entries on altcoins that have locked you out and don''t have any clear HTF levels nearby. Simplest example is waiting for BTC/ETH to pull back to support, and buying the altcoin(s) of your choice once you get a valid long trigger on BTC/ETH. Paying attention to BTC/ETH can also serve as a decent ''reality check'' so you''re not tagging on a ton of blind altcoin risk at potential market-wide sticking points.

That''s most of it, I think.

Again, there''s never a perfect time to make a post like this: if I do it during low vol chop then nobody cares, if I do it now, it''s seen as some sort of prognostication of future conditions. I don''t know what the future holds, just wanted to get this piece of content out of the way so I can refer to it if/when appropriate.

Please Read this before the peak of this Cycle.

A quick tutorial about
1. The Retard Curve.
2. Genius Virus.

Something that you need to understand is the facade and lie of believing that you are a great trader. 

In the Bull Market, everything goes up. You buy, hold and become rich. 
You become richer than your entire generation. 
But for how long?

These profits infect you with the genius virus with no symptoms. Your portfolio is already on the path to death, and you are unaware of the 100% fatality rate of this infection.

One of the highest Alpha tweets I''ve seen recently is by @RookieXBT 

"You are not a good trader, price is just going up"

This increase in Net-worth in the bull market makes you believe that you are a great trader, a whisperer of the market and rider of waves.

In reality, you have entered the market during its sweetest spot. Simply riding to the greed land. You will soon be robbed.

Bull market comes with the charm of quick gains but also with the curse of playing in the easy mode. 

You become the God of easy mode and the lamb of indecision mode. 

The rudest thing @insiliconot  once told, after I had tweeted that only people in their second cycle of this market can make money, 
but he said even ''''They will lose it all again''''

Even the ones who made money in the second cycle, even the ones who were armed with the lessons of loss and learnings of the first cycle, would lose.

What he meant is that price appreciation makes everyone feel like a genius. The rise in price makes everyone feel rich and instills a belief that you are a great trader.

But in reality, only price is going up, not your trading skills.

So, why a lecture on a Monday?
For an introspection for your actual ability being lower than you believe.

Well, I was here in 2017 and the Price Pump and wealth creation we saw was unlike ever seen, in the history of capitalism.

Yet, even after Bitcoin Pumping 2000% in one year and other coins Pumping 100000000%, rarely did we have a friend who came out, richer and Victorious.

The crux of the matter is, 
1. Always remember that you are stupid and you are just getting lucky.

2. You are nothing more than the retail. A potential exit liquidity for people who are creating the narrative, with a team full of triple PhD in Physics. 
Luring you in that breakout trade, only to dump on you.

So your agenda from this day should be to make money and get ahead is retarded curve .

Retarded curve is the lord of all Crypto people, even Old Gods.

You enter Crypto and You don''t even realize but the retarded curve has entered your life. 

Constantly injecting into you, the virus of being a follower of the trend and then the believer of the trend and then marinating you in God complex of making profits. 

Making you feel like you are the king of crypto narrative rotation.

You keep thinking rotation play will last forever and you think you are smart by ''knowing'' that the market will dump to the underworld, someday. 

The philosopher trader in you, who thinks he''s on the right side of the Normie curve, doesn''t realize this.

''You CAN''T time it, you won''t time it, even with all the lessons of losing the generational wealth''

You would be in a position, in 10 coins which are the top tier cream of the crypto market because your millionaire Crypto influencer from Dubai told you.
You believe the influencer because he''s rich and he praises Allah a lot and he can''t scam you because scamming is a sin in his religion.

Your crypto top cycle might look like

1. Price drops a bit and you read influencer''s tweet that it''s just normal Dump and you need to zoom out.

2. Your portfolio is already dead but you don''t know it. Your desperation to make it back is the ignition to this detonation of all your wealth.

3. You then keep listening to youtubers who are calling it just a correction like Haejin Lee in 2018.

4. Influencer tweets about being a diamond hand, holding the wall and being a soldier.

5. Price dumps lower than the meteor''s crater. All your gains are wiped out. 

6. Influencer tells you to not sell until in profit, no matter what. You have waited so long, wait for some more.

7. Desperate, You join a paid group to make back. You have already signed up for a 3 year depression, you just don''t know it yet.
Paid group blesses you by dumping the pre sale tokens on you, the ones they got for shilling for free, for shilling.

In the end when you are back to zero, You read inspirational tweets about holding tight and making it back in the next cycle. The tweet gives support to everyone who lost, it gets 2000 likes. 

In short, bet, manage, know your exit. You don''t have to compare yourself to others because those shouting and screaming the most will lose eventually. Lose big.

And you, if you just decide to be cautious, make less but protect more, will be ahead of them Because you''ll come out of this roller coaster, alive.
Take the risk but please have an exit, the faster you cut losses, the slower your portfolio dies.

I’ve picked up ~$10,000 worth on this public account so you guys can follow along with the progress. 

It’s quite simple- if we aren’t trading at over ~$54,000 by December 29th 2023, these options will expire worthless and I’ll lose the $10,000. If we are trading above, I’ll profit. 

Most will agree that the mid to high 40k region is our “line in the sand” between new all time highs or a major correction back down and more sideways action until 2024/2025, so if my thesis is wrong we shouldn’t be trading above $54k by the end of the year much less above prior ATH. 

You can tell that the market is not pricing in this type of volatility because of how cheap these options were. Suffice it to say, not many are expecting new all time highs by the end of the year and this really is an extremely contrarian idea. However, this is also why the payoff (if correct) is so significant.  

At ~$54,000 $BTC at time of expiry (Dec 29th 2023) I breakeven on this bet. 

For every ~$2,000 above that (again at time of expiry), expected profit climbs by about $50,000. 

At prior ATH (at time of expiry), profit would be around $400,000 and so on and so forth. 

A couple things to note as I end this post:

When you buy call options like this you are essentially placing a time limit on your thesis. If you believe BTC is going to new all time highs and it takes longer than you expect and you’ve bought call options with an expiry that is before this point- it doesn’t matter if BTC goes to all time highs after that- you lose your investment.  

Alternatively, if you just buy spot $BTC and hold, it doesn’t matter how long it takes for new all time highs to be met- you WILL profit when that time comes (assuming you didn’t sell somewhere along the way). Which is also why my spot holdings are far more significant than this $10,000 options bet which I know I can afford to lose. 

Timing the market is a LOT harder than most think which is why options are not suited for most. The majority will be better off just buying spot and holding. I’m saying this to EMPHASIZE, DO NOT COPY ME with this if you’re not experienced with options AND UNDERSTAND you could (and based on the market’s expectations, probably will) lose it all. 

With that out of the way, let’s get this show on the road and (hopefully) enjoy the ride.

Trading this chop in the last 2 months have been quite profitable. Rational price action analysis, no hopium. 

We got a reaction at expected key level $25.2k (6%) 
e.g. entered $TRU 20%. TP 

I still advise patience. 
Prefer to buy the breakout or even better, another swing low, and only if price action looks primed.

That number has only INCREASED through 3AC, the FTX collapse, AND recent actions against Coinbase/Binance from the SEC.

There is LESS EXCESS SUPPLY available than there has EVER BEEN in the history of Bitcoins existence. What does this mean?

The situation with Bitcoin right now is like a kerosene soaked rag in the middle of a forest filled with dead trees- all it will take is a single spark of demand (could be in the form of a number of positive fundamental catalysts- the reason behind the spark doesn''t matter) to set that rag on fire.

And once that rag is on fire the move up will start. Slowly at first, then all at once- just as a forest fire starts from a single spark and soon becomes an uncontrollable blaze, obliterating anything and anyone in it''s way.

If supply continues to constrict as it has been, and those HODL''ers are not selling- regardless of the crash of some of the biggest VC''s/firms in this space, regardless of the crash of the 2nd largest exchange in the world, and regardless of the SEC and their enforcement actions, then it is an INEVITABILITY that price is going to rise to new highs.

And my bet is that it happens sooner than anyone is expecting.

People keep saying they expect months of sideways action to allow for accumulation until the halving in ''24- which should lead to new all time highs in ''24-''25.

But the reality is clear- and can be summed up by the image below. Accumulation HAS ALREADY OCCURRED- more Bitcoin has been accumulated by HODL''ers than EVER before. The "accumulation phase" that so many are waiting for/expecting has already happened!

This is simply another factor/piece of evidence that aligns with my thesis of new all time highs this year. Yes, I could be wrong, but the data supports my ideas.

It would not surprise me to see us chop around between the RED and GREEN regions below for another few weeks. 

Any move above 28.5k and we will have broken a key market structure level that would imply that our corrective structure has completed and we may have begun a new impulsive move.

⚡️ Bitcoin Risk Signal: The signal is back in the (lower) elevated zone, driven by institutional interest. Furthermore, the current volatility could help break resistance levels.

4 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving Rally

Approximately 21 days remain until the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024

And ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

History has repeated in this respect

In fact, the Pre-Halving Rally breakout was a little ahead of schedule by a handful of days

Moreover, Bitcoin performed a historic, never-before-done feat in its price action in the Pre-Halving period by breaking to new All Time Highs...

That being said however, the upside momentum has since slowed

In fact, Bitcoin in recent weeks pulled back by -18%

It is clear that the "Pre-Halving Rally" phase has transitioned into the next phase in the Bitcoin Halving Cycle: 

The "Pre-Halving Retrace" phase

As a result, it is very likely that the "Pre-Halving Rally" phase is over

Bitcoin has since transitioned into the "Pre-Halving Retrace" phase

2. Final Pre-Halving Retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur a 28 to 14 days before the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep and lasted 3-4 days

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep and lasted 56 days (8 weeks)

Currently, $BTC is 21 days away from the Halving, pulled back -18% last week, and since has recovered to ~$70000

If the Pre-Halving Retrace bottom is in...

BTC therefore would''ve repeated a lot of qualities from the Pre-Halving Retrace of 2020 

After all, the most recent retrace was -18% deep and lasted 7 days or so

However, Bitcoin in 2024 also repeated some 2016-like qualities as well

Because Bitcoin began its Pre-Halving Retrace ~30 days before the Halving whereas in 2016 Bitcoin began its retrace 28 days before the Halving

As a result, it looks like Bitcoin may be repeating pieces of both 2016 and 2020 Pre-Halving price tendencies

But the goal of a Pre-Halving Retrace is three-fold:

a) To offer one final bargain-buying opportunity in the Pre-Halving period

b) To form the Range Low of the future Re-Accumulation Range

c) To set up the next phase in the Bitcoin Halving Cycle: "Re-Accumulation" (red box)

3. Re-Accumulation

The beginning of the "Re-Accumulation" phase occurs once the Pre-Halving Retrace has bottomed

In other words, the bottom of the Pre-Halving Retrace becomes the bottom of the Re-Accumulation Range (red)

It''s still uncertain if the Pre-Halving Retrace bottom is in

However, because a Pre-Halving Retrace has occurred already...

It is possible that Bitcoin is slowly transitioning away from its Pre-Halving Retrace phase into its "Re-Accumulation" phase (red)

The goal now is for Bitcoin to move sideways going into the Halving and beyond

The Re-Accumulation phase can last multiple weeks and even up to 150 days (i.e 5 months)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

However, in this cycle it is the very first time that this Re-Accumulation Range is developing around the New All Time High area

As a result, this Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range like we''ve seen throughout the cycle thus far and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation

4. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend

Historically, this phase has lasted just over a year (~385 days) however with a potential Accelerated Cycle occurring right now, this figure may get cut in half in this market cycle

The Bitcoin "Danger Zone" (orange) is where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun

Bitcoin retraced -18% since entering this "Danger Zone"

As a result, this "Danger Zone" has come to full fruition

So unless Bitcoin experiences a second Pre-Halving Retrace which has never happened before...

The "Danger Zone" is over

Bitcoin has been sandwiched inside this Weekly range (black-black)

This Weekly range is essentially formed by the candle-bodied 2021 peak & the upside wicking 2021 peak

Reclaiming the ~$69200 Range High as support could confirm the end of this pullback period and confirm that Bitcoin is ready to breakout from this Weekly range and

Let me break it down:

I have previously said many times that alts will begin outperforming once $BTC breaks prior ATH. But exactly when will they take the lead?

Two scenarios that have played out in the past:

1. BTC breaks prior ATH with conviction and goes on to 2x in a matter of weeks- this is a mega breakout without much of a breather and alts don''t get much love until BTC pauses after this breakout leg.

2. BTC tags prior ATH but rejects/consolidates at the highs for a few weeks before beginning to accelerate to the upside to then double in a matter of weeks. Alts begin rallying right after BTC tags prior ATH, while BTC consolidates.

In the former scenario, alts begin rallying en masse some weeks after BTC breaks prior ATH. In the latter- they start rallying almost immediately after BTC tags prior ATH. 

The common theme here and the key takeaway, is that after BTC hits prior ATH, alts begin rallying at the first major pause/consolidation of BTC, whether that at prior ATH or far above it.

I do not know which scenario we will get this time, but the bottom line is patience pays here, literally. A mega alt season is around the corner, one way or another.', '', '', '', False, NULL, False, 832313, 3312, 529, 203, 395272, 21765.30, 8.56), (19533, '2024-03-02 10:21:57.000000', 1763872363093831994, 'CredibleCrypto', 944746889194364928, 'twitter', '$BTC looks ready for the next leg.

Some Predictions for this Bull Market🚀

1. People are speculating that we haven''t endured enough pain during this cycle, suggesting that this pump may not signify the real bull market.

While it''s true that the 2018-2020 bear market was profoundly more depressing, I contend that we have indeed endured significant challenges in this cycle. Scandals, doubts surrounding exchanges, and substantial financial losses have characterized this period.

Thus, in my view, this is indeed the real bull market, heralding a new paradigm where BTC could potentially hit all-time highs before the halving.

2. Whether you embrace or disdain it, a considerable amount of money will be made  in meme coins.

Stock and asset prices surge when demand is high, and meme coins, with their immense demand, offer swift hopes of wealth accumulation. 
Human greed serves as the primary driver of irrationality, and we are bound to witness its effects once more. Many will suffer substantial losses in meme coins through rug pulls, pump and dump schemes, and worthless projects, yet these incidents often go unnoticed. Therefore, if you choose to engage with meme coins, exercise caution and allocate conservatively.

3. Many individuals employing higher leverage will face significant losses, with no easy remedy.

Given the substantial volatility expected, options may present a preferable alternative, although their effective utilization remains elusive to most. Consequently, if you are holding assets, especially altcoins with inherently higher volatility, high leverage is unnecessary. It is prudent to stick to spot positions in such cases.

4. Pullbacks, particularly in Bitcoin, are inevitable, presenting buying opportunities during dips—although few will capitalize on them.

I anticipate this phase to last for approximately another eight months before another reset occurs. Nevertheless, once the Federal Reserve initiates rate cuts, another cycle will likely ensue.

We got another pop, another sell-off, and back to where we were in my post 6 hours ago, but there are some key differences this time. 

First off, this most recent rejection and drop was NOT spot selling off like we have seen every other time at our range highs- it was levered longs taking profit. Spot actually isn''t selling this rally for once (at least not yet).

Because this little rejection/sell off was caused by levered longs taking profit we saw a decrease in funding, a decrease in the perp premium, and a decrease in OI- all things we WANTED to see for a sustainable uptrend, and we saw it all without getting much of a flush/pullback. 

With that being said, OI still has room to fall IF spot takers start selling here (which they haven''t yet), and this is still technically a failed breakout from our range for now, so I''m a bit split in terms of bias on lower timeframes atm.

The key metrics that we look at to determine if we are "overheated" in the short term (OI, funding, perp premium) all got a little bit of a cool off with this local rejection. If we DO see further downside, they probably cool off even more- setting us up for a very healthy rally to come. 

That being said, it''s all gonna come down to whether or not spot takers begin selling here or not. 

If they do and they force us lower- we probably get a full reset of our key metrics across the board which would be fantastic for the next move up. 

If they don''t and they keep buying, well then for the first time since this HTF range was formed we may be on the verge of a legitimate breakout.

Let''s see how things develop.

Let''s take a look at some developments on this data since my last post below:  

First, aggregate OI continues to fall within this tight range, indicating we are getting some de-leveraging here which means liq cascades in either direction may not be as significant. This is healthy.  

Second, Coinbase has not begun selling off its spot and rather has been consistently buying since my last post. This is healthy.  

Third, we can see that despite takers net selling within this tight range (thanks to Binance spot sellers who have market sold 50M vs Coinbase''s 20M in buys) price has remained flat- indicating we likely have limit buyers absorbing a significant portion of these market sells. This is also healthy.  

Finally, funding and prep premium has been relatively flat since my last post as well, also healthy.  Overall I think that dips here may be even more shallow than originally anticipated due to the lack of OI to induce liq flushes and the clear spot demand we are seeing at these levels.   

We have some potential liquidations above 38k and some below 37.5k, but the amount of open positions here is relatively low- so not expecting huge volatility in either direction until our breakout unless spot flows shift dramatically.   

While I was looking for a dip to 36.9k in my last chart shared on Twitter (here: https://t.co/QaERz10D0R) it seems like even that may be out of reach at the moment.

CVD is essentially a visualisation of market buys minus market sells.

Unlike the previous posts on funding rates and open interest, CVD is slightly more niche.

CVD is typically used to infer aggressive participation i.e. traders executing via market orders/crossing the spread.

These traders take liquidity and typically trade with passive traders i.e. limit orders resting in the order book.

As with most indicators, CVD is most interesting and relevant when some sort of divergence is visible.

In my view, the two most notable forms of divergence are the following:

1. CVD diverging from price. These are standard oscillator-style divergences e.g. CVD makes a higher high while price makes a lower high / CVD makes a lower low while price makes a higher low. 

This is evidence of absorption i.e. aggressive orders being ''absorbed'' by passive orders (colloquially, trying harder and having a diminishing impact on price). 

The divergences described above are typically more impactful than the other way around e.g. CVD makes a lower high / price makes a higher high. 

In general, for reversal setups and intraday trading, you want setups where the more aggressive participants are not being rewarded.

2. Spot/Perp CVD divergence. On average, with many exceptions (mostly discussed in the funding rates post), perp markets provides a better proxy for aggressive traders than spot markets. 

Perps - by virtue of the high leverage available - attract a lot of casual punters who simply want to ape some positions. While it''s not entirely accurate to posit that perps = dumb / spot = smart, it''s worth being aware that perps attract more aggressive positioning and sloppy execution on average. 

With that in mind, it can be useful to overlay perp CVD with spot CVD to see which side is being aggressive, and importantly, to what effect.

Common examples of reversal setups include an aggressive ramp up in perp CVD into a key level with no spot follow through or even spot selling / aggressive ramp down in perp CVD into a key level with no spot follow through or even spot buying.

One can also identify more nuanced examples e.g. spot and perp CVD generally aligned, price reaches key support and perp CVD becomes more aggressive and makes a lower low while spot CVD makes a higher low / price reaches key resistance and perp buying becomes more aggressive and makes a higher high while spot CVD makes a lower high.

 In other words, it can be useful to observe which side ''takes over'', and to what effect, at inflection points. 

On average, for reversal trades, perps getting disproportionately aroused  at key levels (relative to their price impact and/or relative to spot markets) can add confluence to reversal setups.

Important caveat.

CVD does not always show the full picture.

When the market is filled with tourists punting leverage on altcoins, CVD can be a reasonably accurate proxy for measuring aggression (whatever that means).

However, when dealing with bigger markets e.g. BTC/ETH with more sophisticated participants and methods of order execution, the picture can get muddied very quickly.

For example, one method of execution is ''limit taking''. This sounds paradoxical as limit orders typically add liquidity, not reduce it. However, this method involves pushing the price up with rapidly repricing and refreshing limit buys (often but not always via spot books). It''s completely conceivable that this results in a ''divergent'' CVD i.e. spot CVD not moving up (or even moving down) despite bullish activity in the spot orderbooks.

This kind of activity can be imperfectly tracked by looking at bid/ask ratios or depth, but you can already tell that treating CVD as an omniscient oracle may give an incomplete view of the market.

There are also examples of market participants being short-term aggressive in perps with the sole intention of filling spot limit orders in the opposite direction e.g. burst of perp buying to fill (typically larger) spot sell orders, which aren''t always fully visible either.

Summary

CVD is cool, but requires the appropriate context and confluence.

Standout divergences, especially in more tourist-dense altcoin markets, can provide useful short-term to medium-term trading signals. This can be especially potent if used as a confluence factor when building a case based on good levels and if funding/open interest support your argument.

Blindly following CVD as bullish/bearish, without nuance and on higher market cap assets probably isn''t the best idea.

This concludes the tripartite series of tweets on futures data stuff (OI/liquidations, funding, and CVD).

1. Even if you are 100% certain about a potential surge, only risk a small portion of your portfolio on a single trade.

2. Over-diversification is not beneficial in the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency is a highly correlated, high-beta market. If you''re building a passive portfolio, be sure about the cycle phase and take fewer assets in your Portfolio.

3. Avoid breakout trading. This cannot be emphasized enough.

4. Take numerous bets with minimal risks. Wealth accumulation occurs gradually through a series of small wins, not through large, infrequent gains.

5. After making a profit, evaluate whether it was achieved through luck or skill. If it was luck, adopt a defensive stance and prioritize preserving your gains.

6. Backtest your trading system before implementing it with a modest amount of capital. Real-world testing with smaller capital yields significant insights. Trading in theory and trading in live markets are vastly different.

7. Recognize that everyone aims to profit and utilize others as exit liquidity. If you follow hype, you become the bottom feeder.

8. Bitcoin is enduring, but exchanges are fleeting. Prioritize establishing a system that safeguards your cryptocurrency without relying on exchanges.

9. On Twitter, everyone claims to be a trader, but few actually are.

10. Before entering a position, consider potential adverse outcomes. Develop a plan for these "wrong scenarios." There is no need to rush, even when the trade appears obvious.

I expect that blue dotted trendline on the right to hold which would mean less than 30 days for this sideways phase to complete and the next move up to begin. Note this isn''t a hard invalidation- just a reasonable expectation.

This is a long post BUT trust me you will learn a lot if you take 5 minutes to read it👇

Pictured below is a cha price with another chart of aggregate open interest below. 

We can see that every time aggregate open interest hits about 10B, it tends to mark a local top and every time aggregate open interest hits about 6B, it tends to mark a major bottom.

So what is aggregate open interest and why is there this type of correlation?

A simple way to interpret aggregate open interest is that it is a measure of the total amount of leveraged positions currently open across all included exchanges. 

In other words- the higher aggregate open interest is, the more "frothy" the markets are as there is a larger amount open leveraged positions and these levered positions are all susceptible to liquidations if price moves against them. 

So at periods of time when the market gets too frothy and open interest is at higher levels (in this case around 10B), we often see some sort of violent move that causes a spike in volatility as the market seeks liquidity and leveraged players/positions are liquidated.

If/when these players are liquidated, their levered positions are forcibly CLOSED, and this causes aggregate open interest to drop. 

When most of the leverage has been flushed out of the system (in this case around 6B)- liquidations occur much less frequently which means volatility decreases and the price can then move back up (or down, depending on the trend) in a healthy manner.

So what can we do with this information and what does it tell us? 

First off, at current levels, leverage is not extremely high or extremely low- we have found ourselves at the middle of our range- so what I am looking for now is a move to either extremity. 

I have drawn two paths (green arrow and red arrow) that would likely take us to either extreme of our range.  

RED ARROW (preferred): This path would occur if we continued down to the mid to low 20k region from current levels- a further flush down to a logical retest level (25k) with some potential wicks below from cascading liquidations (wicks into 23-24k are fine) that would ideally flush out remaining levered players and bring us back down to a minimally leveraged (healthy) market environment from which we can continue on our way up to 30k+ and ultimately new all time highs.

GREEN ARROW (alternate): Alternatively, if we continue up from here without getting a proper flush to 25k levels and aggregate open interest continues to climb and approach 10B as we push back into the 30k''s- we have to remain cautious as it may simply be another fakeout to bait aggressive players in before a larger OI flush to sub 25k occurs.

Finally, is there a situation in which we DON''T need to revisit 25k and below and simply continue up and leave 25k and below untapped? 

Yes, but in order for this to happen we would need to move up WITHOUT OI rising too much which would indicate that the move up is primarily spot driven, which is healthy and sustainable. 

Overall I prefer the RED path as it would give us a visit to a logical support level and weekly bullish retest, while wiping out any excess froth from levered players which would allow us plenty of room to continue this healthy uptrend to new all time highs.

Because all of these applicants are fighting to get the first customers.

Historically, Bitcoin tends to perform its Pre-Halving rally ~60 days before the Halving (light blue)

Which means...

If $BTC is going to perform a deeper correction during its Pre-Halving period (orange), it should occur over the next 40 days or so

Been hearing this since 25k. 

Meanwhile funding and perp premium have decreased drastically since this last impulse up while we have been chopping in this right range.

This isn''t frothy- it''s extremely healthy and increases the odds that we just keep pumping into ETF approval without much of a pullback at all.

5 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving period

Just over 100 days remain until the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024

Historically, any deeper retraces that occur during this period tend to generate fantastic Return On Investment for investors in the several months after the Halving

Could this retrace be a result of hype and speculation surrounding the Bitcoin ETF finally being resolved?

That means a deeper retrace could occur within the upcoming two months or so, between now and early March

This upcoming two month period will be crucial as any retrace during this period will likely represent the final bargain-buying opportunity for Bitcoin

2. Pre-Halving rally

Then ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

In anticipation of the Halving, investors "Buy the Hype" in an effort to "Sell the News"

Short-term traders and speculators "Buy The Hype" several weeks before the Halving in anticipation of making a profit from this hype-fuelled rally

Then these speculators "Sell The News" to realise that profit, contributing to a Pre-Halving retrace which occurs only a handful of weeks before the Halving event itself

3. Pre-Halving retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur around the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep

This Pre-Halving retrace can last multiple weeks, making investors question whether the Halving was a bullish catalyst on price after all

4. Re-Accumulation

The Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

5. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new All Time Highs

1. AVWAP from 49K remains to be an important level.

Spot bids were absent post ETF approval and hence we dumped.

2. Current Value Area of range since early January remains solid. Price continues to range within the VaH and VaL for now

3. Our bias for swing trades has been to the downside since last week. The more time we spend ranging, the less confident I get on this bias. However, a good target is around January Low + nPOC marked.

4. In ranging conditions, Monday range is most important as always. Any deviation of range highs or lows will be an entry trigger.

5. Price is still fluctuating around the AVWAP + range POC. Price around POC suggests that from a volume perspective price is at a "fair" price.

Despite a slight uptick in interest rates on Friday, the bond market predicts multiple Fed cuts this year.

 Job growth remains strong, with a surplus of vacancies compared to job seekers, posing challenges for employers.

Conclusion: With even Fed hawks conceding to economic catch-up and FOMO driving investor sentiment, the market''s upward trajectory seems likely to continue.

Intro:
BTC bulls faced an unforeseen challenge in August, marking a departure from the usual trajectory. The month witnessed a notable and unexpected 11% decline.

What is the significance of the RSI?
Despite the hardships of August, there''s an interesting development in BTC''s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has climbed to 28 from oversold levels. 

Conclusion:
Past trends suggest that such movements often indicate the potential for upward price shifts.
This implies that as sellers grapple with further drops, the stage might be set for a reversal in the near future.

Here is my step-by-step approach and breakdown of the chart to explain my thoughts and how I would approach this:

We can start off by identifying key swing highs and swing lows- these are the levels marked off as "LOW" and "HIGH" in the chart below. We then look to see which of these levels has been broken during subsequent PA. We can see that our "LOW" has been broken (making a lower low) and our high remains unbroken (making current PA a lower high). At this stage, and at the highest level visible on the chart, we can conclude that we may be in a potential downtrend.

Now let''s look at what else we can see to determine if it''s likely that this downtrend continues or if it''s more likely that the trend is broken. To answer this question, let''s looks at logical draws on price (liquidity) and see if we can easily identify the path of least resistance for price to move towards:

On the chart below, I''ve marked off the two logical areas where we can expect resting liquidity with a RED X- the untapped/unbroken highs above us and the series of higher lows below us (near the bottom of the range).

I''ve also marked off some price zones in red and green (some call them gaps, or fair value gaps- same thing) to help identify regions in which PA moved inefficiently.

What does this means and why is it important? 

To simplify, imagine if you had a market with 100 buyers and sellers. 45 of them are interested in buying/selling at the range lows and 45 are interested in buying/selling at the range highs, but only 10 are interested in buying/selling in between. As price moves to the range highs and range lows we see lots of chop/trading as buyers and sellers duke it out to determine fair value. As price moves into the middle of the range, there aren''t many who are willing to transact at those prices, so the books are thin, volume is low, and price quickly moves through these zones with little resistance. This inefficient PA as we like to call it is often revisited and price often traverses through these regions quickly when it does because of the lack of buyers/sellers in these zones. This also means that these zones don''t do well as support/resistance. In other words- clusters of consolidation where lots of trading took place will often act as support/resistance whereas the inefficient moves between clusters of consolidation are often easily moved through with little resistance.

Now applying that idea to our chart above, we can see that the inefficiency left behind by price in green has been FILLED (meaning price has revisited it and "patched" the inefficiency) whereas the inefficiency below us in red remains unfilled. 

We can also see at the top left corner of the chart, that we have some more significant inefficiencies above our range altogether- so do we target the RED inefficiency below us or do we target the GREEN inefficiency outside/above our range? 

Let''s take a closer look at PA to help us answer this question:

If we look at where our reversal at our lows occurred we can see that smaller TF wicks below the range were bought up. These are signs of absorption (buyers stepping in to support price at these levels). If we look at where we are now, we can see the same- sellers stepping in to sell at these prices, the same way buyers stepped in to buy at the lows. This tells us, that while we do have some inefficiencies above our range, at this time, sellers are stepping in at the range highs and there is increased sell pressure at these levels which may prevent the range highs from being broken and the inefficiency above from being filled.

Because of increased sell pressure at these levels (evidenced by the wicks to the upside) the path of least resistance (at least in the immediate short term) may be down- and because of the large looming inefficiency below us it shouldn''t take much downwards PA for price to completely reverse this entire last move up and fill the inefficiency below us. 

Putting this all together, let''s take a look at what my expectations are here based on the logic shared above: 

With all this being said, it''s important to understand that there are no guarantees in markets and the above is a logical conclusion based on the data that we can see on the chart (which in and of itself encompasses all known market information at any given time) but by no means a guarantee. We CAN see something different play out. Some have suggested a move above the range highs as a range deviation before continuation down, others have suggested a move above the range highs to fill the large inefficiency in the low 20k''s- all of these are certainly viable possibilities- however- until the range highs (marked as HIGH) are breached, neither of these scenarios can come into play which is why my primary expectation is the one shared above. 

I hope you enjoyed this post, if you liked it and/or learned something from it please like, share and comment. It let''s me know that these posts are of interest to my followers and encourages me to produce more of them.

Thanks for the support!

PS. The chart above is inverse BTC- meaning its the BTC chart flipped upside down. So, a move down on this chart means a move UP on BTC in real life and vice versa. Hopefully this helps sheds some light on why I''m bullish on $BTC at this time (I always have a reason for "number go up").', '1696233516466585703.jpg', 'Creditlecryste pubtshed on Trading view com, Aug 28, 2023 1805 UTC silks. oom 10, 4 96 H28232.88 125880.00 C26N1LO2 +2186 (0.06%)  HIGH  uso 22300.00 22580.00 22880.00 23200.00 23500.00 23800.00 24100.00  24400.00  26200.90  28400.00  Bea  p2e800.00 2720000 27800.00 28200.00 28400.00 2809.00 29200.00 29609.00  P30100.00  90800.00  tow  &  31600.00 3200.00 32400.00 3300.00 34700.00  1200.00  38400.00  14 May 1" Ape 17 May 1s = 14  rading View  *)  7  a9  14  Sep  18  16  Now  2028  ', '', False, NULL, False, 266987, 466, 67, 78, 395268, 6268.67, 6.97), (16048, '2023-08-26 04:06:23.000000', 1695286544322761159, 'CredibleCrypto', 944746889194364928, 'twitter', 'Largest liquidation event since Dec ''21 (yes, nearly 2 years ago), 2x that of FTX collapse.

Let''s go Data Diving into Bitcoin.

The market has been a mixture of a graveyard, fear and lack of liquidity. Some are calling for 10K, some are calling for 70.

Hope seems to be short lived, so let''s find out with data, where exactly is Bitcoin at?

Exchange NetFlow and spot selling data shown above, shows that currently, investors are not even close to the panic levels of past instances of more than 10% intra-day drops.

Most outflows (Withdrawal from exchange) were after the drop on August 17th. That means spot demand at $24k and above is strong and some traders are moving BTC off exchanges into cold storage.

Note- People move coins off exchange when they intend to hodl and not sell.

Estimated leverage ratio above is a forecaster of volatility, which remains low after the dump in price to $25k.

Short-term holder supply has also decreased which means that there is not much basis for volatile moves, neither is there a  downside catalyst.

Although Nvidia brought in hope for the market, the Jackson Hole was a bearish catalyst for US stock market. Expectations for more rate hikes this year increased more than 20% since Jackson hole, but Bitcoin remained stable. 

In fact, OI increase and volatility increase during macro events has reduced now, this is also seen through historical volatility and estimated leverage ratio.

Ethereum OI on Binance reached a two year low, illustrating the lack of leverage and hence, volatility prospects

12.8% of the supply went into an unrealised loss after the dump. Still most long-term supply remains inactive. This is bullish, in fact, the top heaviness has been reduced. Market is considered to be near a short term top when too much of onchain supply is in profit.

That’s been cleared as 12.8% supply went underwater in 2 hours with this move.

Stablecoin supply of USDT shown above, increase of USDT usually foreshadows bull trends. 

Supply on exchanges increased slightly but that could have just been traders exiting positions and hence moving back to stable coins. Mean transaction volume has reached a one-month low now.

There is no USDT in transit or moving to exchanges that''s of any reporting value.
 USDT issuance has not taken place since June. This means recovery from this will take time and we can slow bleed with low volatility.

TL;DR - Bitcoin stays as strong an asset as ever on the long term. 
If you want to not lose hair, buy BTC and walk away for 2-3 years. 
Volatility is not going to be consistently high any time soon.
If we recover from here, it’ll take some time and strong bullish catalysts for a pump towards 35K. 

Likely scenario currently is slow bleed slightly lower but no instant dumps for now. 

Bull case is that Short term holders have sold and Long terms holders refuse to sell spot for now.

Introduction:
Bitcoin''s journey in August has caught attention in the crypto world. Like a memory from June 2022, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) makes people wonder about September. Questions arise about pain below $25.5k and the lack of buy orders above $26k.

Charts & Now:
The charts suggest weaker short-term energy, possibly affecting the $25.2k level. This is different from the neutral long-term view.

Outlook:
September could bring good news as the RSI hints at a possible comeback. But we need to be careful because going below $25.5k and rising above $26k might not be easy.

To answer this question, we need to first focus on August

What was the worst #BTC August drawdown in history?

-17% in 2014 and -18% in 2015

Currently in 2023, $BTC is now down -16%

If BTC were to drop -18% this August, BTC would drop to ~$24700

But that might not be the end of the retrace

Why?

Two reasons:

1) BTC is forming a Double Top

And 2) BTC tends to experience single-digit drawdown in September

So if BTC retraces, say, an additional -10% in September...

That would mean price would drop to ~$22200

Then that would approximately match the Measured Move target for the Double Top breakdown of ~$22000

1. Remember that Indicators are statistics, numbers. 

They are not exit and entry Signals.

If you use Indicators like a tool for trading Signals, you will be rekt Swiftly. Remember, Swiftly.

2. Buying a coin that appears over and over in the Crypto influencers/Shillers tweets. 

They are paid to tweet and sell their soul. 
If you keep buying and holding to that garbage, you will get rekt. 
Remember, you are nothing but exit liquidity to them.

3. Trading with too much Capital.
You look at other traders Posting Big Position Size and bigger Profits. 
You want your traders to be big too and you put all you have in one Trade.
Your Position Size still appears small so you use some leverage to make your Position Size look like a good Big number.

2 days later, you lose it all.
Using too much Capital on a single trade and putting it all at risk if one way VIP ticket to Bankruptcy. 
Risk very little, maybe a little more when all things have been considered and be okay with smaller wins. 
Small wins compounded turns into a Beast. 

4. Expecting too much Profit in every trade.
It''s become a norm for Crypto Twitter to expect 10x to 100X.

People don''t realise that investors in the real work are happy with 1% a Month.
Of course you can expect more in Crypto because it''s more risky but keep that in mind to protect your downside.

What happens to your coin after you take Profits doesn''t matter. Take profit, secure it in real world, be Happy.

If you want to explore realistic ways to really improve your Crypto trading, I suggest you read The Bitcoin Trading Master-Class Mentorship.
It''s free and will always be.

It''s the my best content you can find for really trading Crypto.

1. Increased EXACTLY till the last support level created after post-halving dump in 2020.

2. Most altcoins already outperforming BTC. We might have a major alt rally while approaching May if BTC remains stable.

This aligns with how Bitcoin Dominance behaves post-halving. What is important to see is when and where does this find support because it''s likely that the next dominance pump will be during a major market correction where people move to BTC as a safe haven.

If I had to take a gambler’s bet, this is how things move now:

1. BTC Recovery till around 68k or maybe ATH. (most top buyers waiting to exit BE there) 

2. Alts have some rallies, expect more from alts that have been strong in the last month (no overhanging supply as most alts like APT/W fell 3X stronger than BTC and have a lot of bag holders looking to exit closer to BE. (Maybe SOL is an exception to this, maybe)

BTC''s 50-day EMA near $62k provides potential support, targeting $72k for a rebound. 

Shorter EMAs signal a tendency to buy, while longer EMAs suggest a preference for selling. 

Given BTC’s recent significant gains of 92% in six weeks, the market behavior may reflect a period of absorbing those gains.

When Could Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Market?

Historically, Bitcoin has peaked in its Bull Market 518-546 days after the Halving (Chart 1)

This is how typical Bitcoin Halving Cycles have progressed

So if history repeats...

Next Bull Market peak may occur 518-546 days after the Halving

That''s mid-September or mid-October 2025

However, Bitcoin is showing clear signs of acceleration in its current cycle given how it reached new All Time Highs by approximately ~260 days ahead of schedule compared to historical norms

That being said, Bitcoin has been experiencing a Pre-Halving Retrace for the past month or so

As a result, Bitcoin has been slowing down and decelerating the cycle by 30 days thus far and counting

So while Bitcoin may have been accelerating by ~260 days last month...

Today this acceleration is now more close to ~230 days due to the current Pre-Halving Retrace

Nonetheless, this acceleration in the cycle may cut the typical Halving Cycle length in half

So if we measure Bull Market peaks from the moment an old All Time High is breached...

Then this perspective suggests Bitcoin would perform a Bull Market Top 266-315 days later from the moment it breaks its old All Time High

Bitcoin broke to new All Time Highs in this cycle last month in March

If the Accelerated Perspective turns out to be true, then the next Bull Market peak may thus occur in 266-315 days

That''s December 2024 or February 2025

In sum, both perspectives are worth considering throughout the cycle, especially if acceleration in this cycle persists

However, the longer Bitcoin retraces or consolidates during certain periods, the more the cycle slows down, pushing the inevitable Bitcoin Bull Market Peak further into the future

🔶 Aggregated liquidation levels expose the stakes: ⬇️ $25.5k drop equals longs'' pain & $25.3k retest. A $26k breakthrough might trigger short squeezes, fuelling upward momentum.

🔷 But remember, in this range, squeeze-led moves don''t guarantee breakouts. It''s a liquidation game. Stay sharp, don''t fall for fake breakouts.

Keep the big picture in focus as we approach these critical levels.

Tightening Bollinger bands hint at further consolidation until short-term level breaks ($25.5k-$26.2k). Once breached, expect a surge in volatility and a journey to the next range.

- Cipher B shows a bearish climate, no buy signals.
- RSI forms a bullish divergence, hinting at potential upward movement. 

Wait for clarity as mixed signals resolve. Patience is key!

Debunked.

FTX has according to this slide 3 billion in crypto ready to dump on the market and send us to goblin town.

But what is the truth?

First, these coins will not be market sold. I bet most will go OTC. Those that aren''t will be sold slowly via market markers, IMO. 

SOL - this is all locked with release of the coins happening over the next 4 years. When this is sold OTC, it will be someone buying FTX''s vesting contract. 

FTT - marked at 529 million here, but the current market cap is 350 million. This coin is basically worth zero though. Who the heck would buy this garbage? No one. 

BTC & ETH - they have a good amount, but not billions. This is absorbable buy pressure. 

Aptos - this is the only one to maybe worry about, but again that would only be if they dumped all the coins in one go. Which they won''t. Remember they want to extract max value from these coins. 

Everything Else - No amounts big enough to be of concern.

It''s impossible." 

About where I think we are now compared to our last impulse. Note that the S/R flip and retest at 10k took about 3 months to complete. 

2 months later we had rallied 90% to new all time highs. 

4 months after that we hit our top for the impulse- just a total of 6 months after completing the S/R flip and retest at 10k, and over 500% higher.

A couple things to note: 

1. We haven''t yet gotten a perfect retest of the black S/R level at 25.2k. Note that in 2020 we tested it and wicked below to complete the retest. This doesn''t HAVE to happen, but it''s certainly possible we haven''t yet put in our local low for this retest. Regardless, downside should generally be limited from current levels if the thesis is valid.

2. While we know history doesn''t necessarily repeat, it often rhymes- don''t expect an exact time + price correlation, the movements should just be *similar*.

3. As stated in previous updates- the ascent on impulses only gets steeper as we move into a parabolic advance- meaning the rate of ascent you are seeing NOW should be the slowest rate of ascent of this entire move to new ATH. This is why such a rapid ascent to prior ATH is not just realistic but in fact expected if we are seeing the beginnings of a major impulse here. Note with both prior impulses of this cycle (3-14k and 10k-60k) bigger candles are seen the higher we climb.

Don''t tell me it can''t be done when it''s literally been done before.

I''ll see you all at new all time highs, likely sometime this year. $BTC', '1661187769354567681.jpg', 'Creditiecryste cubtshed on TrdingiView com, May 24, 2023 0879 UTC  Biocoln / U.S. Delis index, 1M, BITMEX O2O2LOT H2HSA75O 125826.90 C27776.09 -2063.29 (-7.02%) JAN 1ST 2024 ae Vol -Tleks: The dats vender doesn''t provide volusse data for this symbok : 420200.00  340200.00 280200,00 230900.00 190000.00 190209.00  136200.00 111000.00  1000.00  76000.00 6MO_  Hye  4358¢0,00 $3800.00 41500,00 35000 2  20600.00  726210.28  16860,00  13820)00  112000  9109.00.  7609.00  8200.00.  5400.00  4409.00  3708.00  3100.00.  2600.00  2189.00  1750.00  1490.00  1260.00  1089.00  Fee ae 2018 May Soo 2019 May Sep 2020 May, Sep 2021 May Sep 2022 May sep 7023 May Seo 2028 May se 2025 Moy sep  ‘FY Tradingview ', '', False, NULL, False, 472289, 1099, 191, 187, 395268, 11788.51, 7.78), (14895, '2023-05-21 19:08:50.000000', 1660362030782771201, 'CredibleCrypto', 944746889194364928, 'twitter', 'A breakout to the upside doesnt just look good from a liquidity perspective it also looks like a logical move from a wave perspective as well.

Major spot driven sell off hit the crypto market at 4:30 a.m. EST on Monday, with BTC dropping 3% to $29k level. 

What to keep on mind:

🔷Open interest remains high, expect more short-term moves.
🔷Uncertain direction: both shorts and longs reemerged with a positive funding rate. 
🔷Brace for a potential squeeze

Unlikely to experience mean reversion on the higher timeframes. We can expect the current rally to continue upwards, with the bottom being close or already in based on historical data.  BTC''s correlation with the SPX is near ATH. This correlation is the reason behind uncertainty over the bottom being in already.  Short-term holders (STHs) are selling spot at a profit; this is seen as the STH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has remained positive for the last week. This fear and selling spot early by retail investors suggests we are deep into the bear market.  Long-term holders (LTHs) are not selling the spot positions they entered during the 2022 bear market yet. This is because the SOPR of HODLers remains negative.  FED NEWS  e  The yield curve is the most inverted since the 1980s. The labour market has begun to show cracks. This inversion, historically, has accurately predicted an increase in unemployment. An inverted yield curve is when interest rates on long-term bonds fall lower than those of short-term bonds.  The US continues to experience a contraction in business activity. “Flash” PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) shows slowing growth in the US business sector. The index is derived from the monthly survey of the private sector companies regarding their current month-over-month economic activity.  Consumers anticipate a recession; this can be seen in rising personal savings rates and a slowdown in demand which has driven down the cost of goods and services.  The advanced reading for the 2022 fourth-quarter GDP number showed that the US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.9 percent.This creates a conundrum for recession predictors.  The FED fund futures prices suggest the market is pricing in a 99.6% chance of a 25bps rate hike in the February FOMC.  The housing market has seen a drastic decrease in home prices and employment in the construction industry. This and labour market data suggest that a recession will happen in the second or third quarter of 2023.  MARKET CHATTER  Tesla has neither bought nor sold any digital assets in Q4 2022.  Dutch central bank imposes a 3.3 million euro fine on Coinbase.  DXP - Vela is a perp DEX launching their private beta on Arbitrum in one day. Public beta to be launched in 2 weeks.  MASK - The metamask token is about to be launched soon; you can be a part of the airdrop by using the swap function on a metamask wallet.  PRICE UPDATES  Spot selling of Bitcoin at key resistances ($23.5k) can be seen. Price is being sustained at these levels by buying on perps. 24K still a formidable resistance and a good area for a flip trade.  Open Interest increased by about 28,000 BTC over the weekend. An easy move would be to flush that Ol over the week.

Some commentary on the "breakout but no pullback" type of price action. https://t.co/eiQ8zh4NHE', '1616601924144340993.png', 'ateintet ceeded  Cred o115/2023 9-55 PM Sober assessment 15/01  Context: Weekend short squeeze led to turbo moon candles during the week.  Present: Bitcoin consolidating above 20k, at 20.9kish, on the weekend,  My view is that this shit is going to have at least another leg. Minimum towards 22.5k.  Trade-wise, this means buying anywhere here (20.9k) with a tight invalidation below the range low (20.5k aggressive).  Several reasons and thoughts.  First, bigger picture, negating FTX dump and reclaiming 20k is HUGE. Technically, psychologically, and narratively. Any reasonable speculator is strongly reconsidering a short to medium term bearish bias at these prices,  Second, these rallies don''t retest. This is the type of shit I teach in hindsight where after a huge impulse, those waiting on the retest eat dust and your only choice is to buy any low time frame consolidation. If I''m right, this pause (on a weekend no less) is the pullback in this context.  Third, the "health" of the rally is supported by the fact that BTC is being bid very aggressively, and the pumps aren''t relegated to alts and lower cap trash. Sure, there’s some froth from the beta effect with even FTT/SRM going up, but the BTC bid is hard to ignore (see: BTC price, ETHBTC, ALTBTC pairs, weekend delta absorption),  Uhad more reasons before I started typing, but they all amalgamate into the same line of reasoning - virtually everyone''s bullish entry trigger is here, as obvious now as it was at 15k i.e. "Reclaim 20k and we''re good to gol”. We''ve literally done it - but the magnitude of the move and the speed has likely left a large number of participants in short-term disbelief.  Also notable: this is without ANY good news. All bad news has been absorbed. My guess is that we''ve also shifted news catalyst structure: from “bad news nukes, good news apathy" to "good news moons, bad news apathy". My view is that the coming week will be more upside, and leave price at a “How the fuck did we get here, we were just at 15k?!" level. In terms of technicals, that''s at a minimum 22.5k,  Final note before I forget: TA-wise, 20k range low has been reclaimed and we closed above the midpoint of the old range (20.7k). Even purely technically, range high makes sense.  Jacveary 18, 2023  Cred o1s3/2023833 Pm Bought some coins at 20700s on this 18/01 evening dip back into midrange level.

BUSD Ol remained constant with little fluctuation. Bitfinex whales had reduced short exposure by 76.4% till January 22nd. New shorts opening around $23k.  Onchain data suggest large wallets (with over $1M BTC) are not selling their BTC at these levels. Spot volume has dwarfed futures volume on this leg up; this spot bid is healthy and shows that the market is not over-leveraged long YET.  The largest amount of short liquidations since 2020 was recorded in the first two weeks of January. ByBit saw the largest short Ol wipeout in the exchange’s history.  Miner stocks saw an 80% decline in 2021-22. Miner capitulation is over, and Miner spot supply pressure is likely to reduce throughout 2023. Miners to exchange inflows are now lower than pre-2020 levels.  FED NEWS  US reached its debt ceiling of $31.4 trillion. The ceiling has already been raised 20 times since 2001. Harsh measures to avoid a default have sent the stock market plunging in the past. (eg - 2011 close call sent SPX -14% in 2 weeks)  Fed’s rate-hike campaign is having the desired effect; falling sales and producer prices are the evidence. FOMC on Feb 1st, soft PPI figures have economists expecting a 25bps hike next. Employment Cost Index will be out on January 31; if it remains strong, then there is still a potential for another 50 basis points hike.  Housing starts and building permits fell month-over-month (MoM) by 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively in December. Mortgage rates are still close to ATH, there is very little demand, and existing home sales continued to decline by 1.5% in December 2022.  Supply bottlenecks to ease as shipping from China to the US is 78% cheaper YoY. Increased supply brought by lower costs would continue to put downward pressure on inflation.  Conclusion: Inflation has topped at least for the first two quarters of the year. 25bps rate hikes can be expected from the Fed henceforth. PRICE UPDATE  On the Weekly time frame, we are still bearish until we flip $25.5k. The level is the last wall to defend for bears.  Daily close above $22k would be another confirmation for the move up to continue. We look good on the daily time frame.  Short-term ranging can be expected here; consolidation under resistance can mean a lot of things, play breakouts or breakdowns like they are until proven wrong. Any pullbacks on Bitcoin are bullish in the short term as long as we don’t break below $19.5k.  MARKET CHATTER  Avalanche partnership with Shopify and AWS. It could follow in the footsteps on Solana and Matic and have a real-world use case narrative.  Liquid Staking derivatives (LSD) related tokens continue to do well. LDO-market leader in this sector. Increasing market share is Frax as it has the best yields and an algorithmic stablecoin. DYDX supply inflation. The DEX token has nasty tokenomics that would see the circulating supply increase by 105% this year starting from Jan 27th.  Genesis declared bankruptcy and has approximately $3.5 billion in debt.

The Drooping Bottom  The Drooping Bottom is almost any kind of a price formation or congestion which tends to come to a drooping point at the close of its development. The formation need not be long. In fact, there are cases where hardly any area picture is discernible, but the drooping point is always there. The Drooping Bottom is more often found, however, developing as part of, or after, an area picture and most frequently, per- haps, from some form of Triangle pattern. To particularize still further, the Drooping Bottom is most frequent and most dependable as a continuation, when it forms the last portion of a Descending Triangle, and in many instances it suggests almost a special phase of that formation.  An interesting example which may be construed as a special phase of the Descending Triangle, or as a drooping slump out of a Rectangle Reversal, is shown in Fig. VIII the chart of Chicago Pneumatic Tool for the first half of 1930.

🔶Small caps surged, while large caps (BTC, ETH) remained stagnant. Momentum dwindled, leading to an overall impulse of 0 in the crypto market.

🔷Without momentum, further upside is unlikely. We need a surge of momentum in the system (BTC, ETH, large caps) to drive prices higher.

The key lies in increasing demand. 💥

🔶XRP''s legal win ignites a bullish wave, propelling altcoins to new heights. Increasing beta suggests a shifting landscape; altcoins now more influenced by BTC.

🔷This increased in beta shows something is changing; alts will react more to BTC. Brace for a reversal: during underperformance, alts may tumble more than BTC. 

To enter the high season, we crave more rising days, fewer downturns.

Still, $BTC Dominance is technically in its "retest mode"

Best case scenario for Altcoins would be for BTCDOM to pull back a little bit more via the orange pathway

Generally, this red area is the region BTCDOM will try to retest as support

Technically, BTCDOM has already repeated the magnitude of the mid-2018 retest

If history were to repeat, BTCDOM will soon reverse with very limited additional downside volatility in the meantime

At the time when I originally shared this, we were trading at 30.3k. 

Time-wise, I was expecting an earlier breakout, but we ended up consolidating longer than expected in the 25k region which, as a result, has pushed the timeline back a bit (not by much, still fully expect new ATH on $BTC in Q1 of ''24). Price invalidation levels (which are more concrete and not as flexible as time) were never hit as we climbed up, maintaining bullish market structure throughout our rise.

In any case- it''s clear that our next major leg up (and the final impulsive leg of this cycle which started in 2018 at 3k $BTC) has begun. And for those who are still in denial, it will be even more clear (and undeniable) in a month or two imo.

In the coming months I expect further continuation upwards, at a more aggressive pace than we have seen thus far, as we build up to what will be a blow-off top for the books to conclude this multi-year cycle.

Whether you believe in a new ATH on #Bitcoin this year or not, this is an idea worth considering imo.

Let''s dive in...

I have spoken for a while about my issues with the almost universally accepted idea of a 4 year, "halving" based cycle many times.

Rather, I''ve proposed the idea of a cycle that lengthens in time from peak to peak while also simultaneously decreasing in ROI from trough to peak. 

This idea was originally presented in 2019 and a refined time horizon was presented in 2020, about 3 years ago, when $BTC was trading under 10k. That idea was shared here: https://t.co/OwQPODqAWw

In the chart shared in the link above, it is clear is that moves from trough to peak were taking longer in time to complete and yielding a lower ROI from start to finish.

This is a very logical/expect conclusion as we know that volatility in any market naturally decreases over time as an asset matures and the earliest participants in any market always have the potential for the highest yield/ROI. 

Based on the chart shared above in 2020, one of the conclusions that was made from it was that this next cycle would not end until "sometime after [the start of] 2023".

Fast forward to Q4 of 2021- we had broken prior all time highs as expected and were trading in the 50-60k range. At this stage, most were calling for a blow-off top into December 2021 and 100k+ $BTC in the next month or two. 

Why? Well because of the "halving" of course. 

You see, our last parabolic run/blow off top occurred exactly 4 years prior- in December of 2017 on our run to 20k. So based on the halving cycle theory, our next blow off top should have come 4 years later- in December of 2021. I was one of the very few at this time that was NOT expecting this- again based on my idea of a lengthening cycle- I believed that this next blow off top should occur in/after 2023. 

So, in December of 2021, when we were trading at 60k+ and the masses were screaming for a blow-off top to 100k+, I published a Youtube video to explain why I expected us to find a local top soon and a correction to at least 30-40k before the *actual* blow off top wave occurred 6+ months later. A full, in-depth breakdown as to how/why I made these claims at the time can be found here if you want to understand the logic further (I recommend finishing this thread and then going back to watch the vid below if interested): https://t.co/fa3McENAaB

What followed was a major crash that hit my target of 30-40k and ended up going even lower due to a series of industry defining black swan events that created a domino effect of bankruptcies, collapses, panic selling and capitulation- 3AC/LUNA, Voyager, Celcius, FTX etc.

At this stage, while we had gone lower than my target of 30-40k, we had not yet hit the invalidation point for this cycle and so while the depth of this major correction was deeper than expected, the high timeframe thesis remained in-tact (logic behind this is also covered in the Youtube video linked two paragraphs ago). 

This is where a major divergence occurs between my ideas and the currently accepted/agreed upon narrative- as the vast majority who witnessed this crash now assumed that our cycle HAD topped at 69k and we are now in the depths of a major bear market with no new all time highs to be expected until after the NEXT halving in 2024. 

Meanwhile, I have maintained, in-line with my ideas shared in 2019, that our cycle that started in 2018 has not yet completed and that we are still missing a final "5th wave" to the upside which has now officially begun off of our lows at 15k. This final move to new highs above 69k would mark the end of a 5 year cycle, the longest cycle we have seen since Bitcoin''s inception and in-line with the idea of lengthening cycles that I''ve proposed earlier.

"But Credible, why would this time be different? We always see new highs only AFTER a halving event. So we will only see new highs after the next halving in 2024."

People have been blinded by the halving narrative so much that they refuse to view Bitcoin''s growth/progression through the lens of anything but a 4 year, halving driven, cycle. I have repeatedly stated that the halving is a KNOWN event, on a set schedule, and that this information is priced in. Especially because at this point 92% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist has already been mined! Take a look at this chart here that I''ve shared without a "halving" related bias and you will see the idea of lengthening cycles makes a lot more sense: https://t.co/ECiEmXrn0S

NOW if we look at that chart above we can see that a Bitcoin cycle top at 69k WOULD be "different", and that if this cycle "is not different" to prior ones the top SHOULD take LONGER to form than prior tops as Bitcoin matures, volatility declines, and ROI from trough to peak of each cycle decreases.

Interestingly enough, the idea proposed above is reflected beautifully in the chart shared below, which is what caught my eye and made me begin writing this tweet in the first place. 

This same data/idea is unknowingly presented in the @glassnode chart below, except at first glance it is depicted through the lens of a 4 year, halving cycle narrative once again. Let''s take that lens off and take another look:

I''ve added annotations to the original chart and the key takeaways are:

1. Every cycle on Bitcoin since inception EXCEPT the one with a proposed top at 69k supports the lengthening cycle, lower ROI thesis.
2. IF our cycle did top at 69k it would be THE FIRST TIME that a full cycle has taken the SAME amount of time as a prior one.
3. IF our cycle did top at 69k it would be the ONLY cycle that topped with a YEAR LONG RANGE as opposed to a blow-off top.

Just like every prior Bitcoin cycle, the cycle that started in 2018 should NOT be over yet, it SHOULD take longer than the prior one, and it SHOULD yield a lower ROI as well.

Our "cycle top" being in at 69k would go against ALL of the above.

So my argument is simple- this time is NOT different. 

We have yet to see the final 5th wave blow off top for this cycle that started in 2018 and we should see new all time highs on Bitcoin this year leading up to it. (For my best guess on when we see new highs, view this tweet here: https://t.co/4MiGtwgeoY)

I also challenge you guys to tag those in the comments that are staunch believers of the halving cycle narrative. Encourage people to open their minds to an idea they have potentially dismissed. Ask them to read this thread and give it a genuine chance, with no pre-conceived notions. I''m always open to respectful discussion of ideas from those with opposing viewpoints and I think it''s always important to keep an open mind and consider ideas that run against the grain.

Aggregate OI is still near 10B which means there IS enough froth in the markets right now to cause another major liquidation flush if price can be pushed low enough.

As I always say- best not to go "all out" or "all in" on the market at times like these as if you''re wrong you''ll either be extremely underexposed or extremely overexposed which leads to emotion-driven (and generally bad) decision making.

🔶Why: Bitcoin has held its ground while altcoins have suffered. However, as the Altcoin Cycle Signal suggests, we are starting to see the first signals of altcoin movement.

🔷Conclusion: The market needs to have an impulse that helps transition from cycle to cycle, and we are not there yet. ETH is trembling because of the lack of demand the rest of the altcoins are missing momentum.

Accumulation on the Rise🚀

🔶Why:
Bitcoin''s price has been consolidating between $29.6k and $31.4k for 18 days, causing mixed emotions among traders. Despite the frustration, the chances of a sudden drop below $29k are low because investors are holding onto profitable positions and accumulating more.

🔵Conclusion:
Bitcoin whales and smaller addresses are taking advantage of the opportunity to accumulate. Excitement grows as the market anticipates the breakthrough moment.

Check momentum signals of:
-Binance
-Cosmos
-Polkadot
-Polygon
-Solana

Why:
🔶Bitcoin''s dominance sets the tone for altcoin performance, albeit at a slower rate.
🔶SOL (Solana blockchain token) outperforms, surging over 11% and continuing to rise.

Conclusion:
🔵Market transition from BTC requires increased impulse in leading altcoin performance.
🔵ETH breaking $2k resistance level is crucial for altcoins to rally.
🔵Recovery is already in progress, signaling a positive outlook for altcoins.

📊 Intro:
 Across assets, choppy moves and consolidation gain momentum. Wave C in a broader correction might drive prices to 104 - 106, prompting a pause in equities and BTC until rates and DXY align.

📈 Main: 
Bitcoin''s weak TradFi links hint at autonomy. A trigger like BTC ETF news could uncouple its price—rallying while equities consolidate and the DXY fades.

 Dynamic shifts in play—watch wave C and Bitcoin''s independent journey. 🌐📊🚀 #MarketShifts #BitcoinFreedom', '1691758205204836423.jpg', 'U.S. Dollar Index, 10, TVC 0102.659 H10).401 L102.771 C103.396 +0,54) (-0.578)  Credit § ‘°° 112.000 / 110,000 1.818(108.062) 108.000 Expanded Flat ) .+.-or we go here...! 1.271106.26) — 106.000 © (10 4 iH  — Needs to end here....

Examples below of $DOGE, $SOL, $PEPE and $LINK BTC pairings are representative of what a majority of ALT/BTC pairings look like at the moment. In the past few months of a consolidating BTC, most ALT/BTC pairings have failed to break any significant bearish market structure and are teetering on the edge of an abyss.

As I''ve previously said, until $BTC breaks prior ATH there is limited liquidity in the system and it will gravitate to $BTC. 10,000 alts sharing liq vs 1 Bitcoin, and it''s easy to understand why most alts will bleed against BTC in this next stage. 

Once $BTC breaks prior ATH and new money starts flooding in, alts will start popping left and right, BTC dominance will begin to reverse to the downside for the first time in over a year, and ALT/BTC pairings will rise with a vengeance. 

I will be looking to shift some of my $BTC holdings into the alts mentioned above at the levels marked off below. $BTC

*NOTE: A falling ALT/BTC pairing doesn''t necessarily mean a falling USD value of said ALT. USD value of an alt can stay stagnant (or even rise) while it''s BTC value drops. What matters here is that even if ALT/USD pairings are stagnant or even rising, if their respective BTC pairings are falling it means BTC is still outperforming them on a % gain basis and it makes more sense to have exposure to BTC (during this time).', '1690767657681776641.jpg', 'CreditieCryste puntshed on Trading View.com, Aug 13, 2023 16:26 UTC ChsinLink J Bacoln, 2M, BINANCE O0,0002071 10.0002634 10.0002006 CO.0002833 «c.cODd462 (+22:3%) ate  ‘9.0022000 .001pe00  9.0026800  9.0012000  o.nor2o00  2.0030800  e.necen00  o.0007590  o.0006800  0.0006700  2.0008800  9,9008200  9.9002100  9.00010  !

It is also not by default, “bullish”.     

Seeing a lot of “if we are so bullish why aren’t we moving up? Bulls don’t have the strength to push price higher, this is bearish.”   

When price is moving sideways it means that neither bears NOR bulls are in the drivers seat- consolidation is by definition NEUTRAL. Buyers and sellers have reached an equilibrium.

9 out of 10 times, consolidation structures resolve in the direction of the trend that preceded them. We have been in a very clean, obvious uptrend since 15k. By default then, one should expect this consolidation over the last month to resolve to the upside. 

Your default stance on $BTC here should be bullish imo, unless we start breaking bullish market structure (first, lowest timeframe level of bullish market structure that matters is 24.8k, marked on the chart.)', '1689848157801529344.jpg', 'CrecibleCrypte published on TradingViemcom, Aug 11, 2023 03:54 UTC  BraveNewCoin Liquid Index for Bitcoin, tO, BNC O29569.19 12970007 129337.16 C2B431.46 -137.29 (-0.46%) orc §1000,00  49090.00 47000.00 - 4500.00 4300.00 41000.00 $} I  3] I 39000.00 =  =  I 37090.00  35000,00  consolidation I ~ 4 3390.00  31600,00  27800.00  consolidation 20600.00  I " 28400,00 last higher low local bullish market structure « il I ¥ 24200,00  23000.00  22000,00 I 21250.00 20460.00 19660.00  18350.00  1000.00  17250,00  16650.00  16050,00  15450.00  14900.00  14380.00  73990.00  Jul Aug Sep Oct Now Dec 2023 Feb Nar Apr May dun jut Aang Sep Oet Now Dee 2024 Feb Mae  ‘TE TradingView ', '', False, NULL, False, 602328, 699, 72, 68, 395268, 10866.48, 7.67), (15788, '2023-08-10 06:18:28.000000', 1689521575433760768, 'CredibleCrypto', 944746889194364928, 'twitter', 'Why the next $BTC halving in April/May 2024 will likely mark our bull cycle TOP rather than the "start" like many are expecting and why we will likely be in the depths of a MAJOR bear market by 2025: 

I''ve previously explained that the amount of time we are spending consolidating/chopping at these levels is going to be the LONGEST amount of time we spend consolidating on our way to new all time highs. 

Once our parabolic advance kicks into gear multi-month consolidations like we are seeing now will be NO MORE.

The chart below demonstrates exactly that. 

In both prior impulses of this cycle, the consolidation phases that preceded our parabolic advances took LONGER than the parabolic advance itself even though that move was 6-8x GREATER in price.

Once we break out of this consolidation I expect that our parabolic phase will begin- and, based on the data below, would expect the parabolic phase to end somewhere around May 2024. 

In other words, I expect our next halving to essentially mark the top (or close to it) of this Bitcoin cycle that started in 2018 at 3k (you can read more about why I believe that the cycle from 2018 did NOT peak at 69k and is still ongoing here: https://t.co/m7zHtVsgK7)

This also means that by the time 2025 rolls around we will likely already be well into a multi-year bear market, leaving those looking for new post-halving highs in 2025, disappointed.  

I''ll cover my expectations of this "secular bear market" in a new Youtube video down the road. You can subscribe to my channel here if you want to be notified upon release of my new long-form video content: https://t.co/jLQv6VBAHy

Coin that holds up during Bitcoin Dump, continues to go up

Coin that goes down hard during the Dump, continues to go down.

At the moment, we have a clean 3 legged move up- if this is going to become a clean 5 wave move up then we would follow the GREEN path here without getting much of a dip.

If we instead go with the BLUE path below then it confirms this move up off the lows as a 3 legged corrective move.

The former scenario is slightly more bullish (impulse off the lows allows for a scenario in which bottom is in- doesn''t guarantee it by any means) while the latter is more bearish (increases odds this is just a deadcat bounce/liq hunt into resistance above before continuation down).

When Could Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Market If The Current Cycle Remains Accelerated?

When Bitcoin rallied to new All Time Highs in mid-March 2024, Bitcoin was accelerating in its cycle by 260 days compared to traditional Halving Cycles

However, since Bitcoin has been consolidating for the past two months or so, this rate of acceleration has decreased to 210 days

So we are currently seeing deceleration in the cycle and it''s possible this will still continue for a while longer

The longer this deceleration takes, the more resynchronised this cycle will become with the typical Halving cycle where Bitcoin tends to peak 518-546 days after the Halving

Until this resynchronisation occurs however, it''s worth considering when Bitcoin could peak in its Bull Market if the current cycle remains accelerated to some extent

So instead of using the Halving as a reference point for measuring a potential future Bull Market peak, perhaps it would be worth using old All Time Highs as a reference point for measuring that

Bitcoin tends to perform a Bull Market Top 266-315 days after it breaks its old All Time High

Bitcoin broke its old All Time Highs in mid March 2024

The next Bull Market Peak may thus occur in 266-315 days

That''s very late November 2024 or very late January 2025

However, as Accelerated as this cycle may be...

It appears that the amount of days that Bitcoin spends beyond old All Time Highs is actually lengthening

In 2013, Bitcoin rallied for 268 days before topping out

In 2017, this figure rose to 280 days (an increase by 14 days)

In 2021, this figure rose to 315 days (an increase by 35 days compared to 2017)

Historically, the amount of days that Bitcoin has spent beyond old All Time Highs have increased by approximately 14 days to 35 days

So how much time could Bitcoin spend beyond old All Time Highs before performing its Bull Market Peak in this cycle?

If we add 14-35 days to the initial Bull Market Peak range of 266-315 days, that would bring the total to 280-350 days

This in turn could push the Bitcoin Bull Market Peak to mid-December 2024 or at most to early-March 2025

But if Bitcoin continues to reduce its current acceleration in the cycle, it would resynchronise with traditional Halving cycles

In which case, checkout this Halving-based analysis on when a Bull Market peak could occur:

https://t.co/WIiM8noArC

Overall, it is worth keeping both perspectives in mind, with the traditional "Halving Cycle" being the primary thesis

In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the Halving

In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the Halving

If history repeats and the next Bull Market peak occurs 518-546 days after the Halving...

That would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September or mid-October 2025

Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 210 days

So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronising this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle

‣ latest LONG (reclaim of red channel range) from $25800
‣ SL tight here, if stopped out looking for price action at mid range or range support  
‣ added inverse parabola & ltf ascending channel into resistance 

If you want to play it safe here, wait for the reclaim of range resistance $27,500 or aim to re-enter around $23878 (expect volatility there observe first).

I Analyzed Bitcoin''s On-chain Activity and Sat through the Fed''s meeting. Here is my Takeaway.

Bitcoin under Whale Accumulation as FED gives moved signals.

1. Rates? Unchanged. Predictable.
2. They''re optimistic on growth, predict lower unemployment, but also anticipate more inflation. That''s a dovish move.
3. But wait, they''re not so keen on rate cuts for next year. Is that Bearish?

So, they''re playing it cool with rates (bullish) but hinting at a tighter stance for 2024 (not bullish).

FED WATCH

FED is in a sticky situation. He''s pausing, likely due to bond market pressures and his own inflation goals. But there''s a twist. Other Fed members aren''t fully on board with his hawkish vibes. Powell''s emerging as the main hawk in the flock.

Market-wise? I''m betting on new Bull Market start earlier than most individuals, by mid-2024. The only hiccup might be a dip to the S&P''s 4300s or even 4200 before a surge.

History shows that post-Fed rate hike pauses, there''s usually a flood of liquidity into markets after about 12-15 months. But this time? I sense it''ll be quicker, maybe 6-9 months.

Prediction: If the Fed maintains this pause to assess upcoming economical data in 2023 Q3 and Q4 (and I think they will), gear up for a Q1 2024 equity boom. And yes, $BTC will likely join the party.

We will discuss where Bitcoin stands currently as well.

One of the most important charts I focus on is a custom chart.

TNX (10-Year Treasury Yields) vs BTC. It''s obvious that when this chart goes lower, BTC goes higher.

2-year yields hit highest level since July 2006 post the Fed decision. 10-year yield is at highest levels since 2007. Market predictions for FOMC decisions have been on point since the past 20 years, not a single surprise since then. Currently, a pause is expected till the end of the year and I think that allows for treasury yields to go down and markets to move up.

Short term yields are high as compared to long-term so there is no incentive for banks to lend, however, I think we are at an inflection point for this process to change right now. Normally when the Fed pauses, you see a yields fall, the only reason yields are heated right now is because markets have not expected an extended pause after Powell''s statements yesterday.

However, TNX/BTC ratio is likely going to crash as it fails to move past the recent resistance with a large number of untapped lows below.

Close below the blue level quickly means that we might see a new ATH for SPX as well as BTC 2023 or early 2024.

Reserve Balances are another measure of liquidity. This has increased since the beginning of the year and will continue to do so IMO. This is still far off from 2021 highs but has retested 2020 liquidity boom levels of support.

Moreover, this has increased prior to stock market booms and close to Fed pauses since 1985.

RANGE STUDY

Macro taken into account, I truly believe that we are due a short squeeze near range highs currently.

There has been no significant movement, we predicted a move down after Monday high sweep near HTF range high, we will now wait for a reaction at weekly open level.

This short-term movement should not distract you from the fact that my long term bias is up, based off of macro as well as crypto data

It is hard to compress all of the data into a single OF chart.

But summarizing the conclusions, perp longs have tried to push through but failed because spot bid is lacking. There have been many mini long squeezes (forced wipeout of perp longs due to aggressive selling) since August 3rd week till now but spot bid has stepped up recently as per my last price update.

Expect this to breakout upwards sooner or later.

On-chain View.

Short-Term Holder SOPR is the best metric to see what retail is doing and the best time to buy is when these guys are selling BTC at a loss.

I applied a moving average to smoothen the curve and the major capitulation events were in July 2022, November 2022 and July 2023. August 2023 has also shown a major buy signal.

Buying spot at these price remains one of the best places.', '1704837366383616080.jpg', 'TNX/ETQUSD, 1D, TC 0.000 +0.000 (+0.52%)  10-Year Treasury Yield Is At Highest Level Since 2007  Aor Jul Oct 2020 Apr jl Oct 2021 Apr Jul Oct 2022 Agr Jul Oct 2023 Apr Jul Oct 2024 ', '', False, NULL, False, 204169, 927, 194, 56, 392681, 7802.97, 7.25), (22266, '2023-09-22 01:36:29.000000', 1705033293840969890, 'CryptoHayes', 983993370048630785, 'twitter', 'UST yields rise, no cash flow long duration assets $XAU and $BTC should dump.

The Dollar Strength Index (DXY) hit its highest point in almost a year. This contrary to the widely-held bearish dollar view, represents a strong shift, now entering a phase of potential consolidation.

DXY needs to cool off and retest previous resistance as potential support for BTC''s recovery. 

Yet, greater market liquidity tends to benefit BTC in the long term, as investors seek alternative assets to hedge against sluggish economic growth.

🎯After Monday''s and yesterday''s price dip and subsequent stagnation, the crypto market is buzzing with activity.

🎯Open interest is soaring, and funding rates have surprisingly turned positive. But here''s the twist: this dip could potentially trigger a ''longs flush'' if the price doesn''t bounce back.

🎯The escalating tensions in Israel have market experts predicting even more volatility on the horizon. While the bullish flag on BTC is still flying high, it''s playing a bit of hide-and-seek.

While our local invalidation just under 27k hasn''t been hit yet, it’s important to plan ahead in case this low-timeframe bultish invalidation level is hit so we are not caught off guard.  Below is a depiction of both BTC and ETH that shows a potential path moving forward in the “worst” case scenacio that I think is feasible.  Once again, you''ll notice that for SBTC I dont expect 24.8k to break and this eemains our HTF invalidation level- so if this were to occur you have, for the thied (and likely last) time, a chance to enter a position with an extremely favorable risk/reward ratio at the lows with a clear invalidation level slightly below it.  SETH on the other hand I would not be surprised to see make a new local low as its range low demand has already bean tested and likely gives: way on another test. We also have an inefficiency right below the range lows and another, more significant region of demand just below.  SETH making another local low while BTC maintains a higher low above 24.8k is also a testament to my idea of an expected weakness on most alts and ETH/BTC for now as BTC dominance rises into new highs.  Remember, the above scenario comes into play on a break of LTF structure and is invalidated if we clear the RED ZONE above us. For more context on why this idea has even come into the picture, please watch my last video update in the quoted tweet below.   CrediBULL Crypto @ «i Crovidic “That was fast, lows cleaned up.

🔶This decline could be attributed to traders choosing self-storage due to regulatory uncertainties, with hopes of re-entering the market later. 
🔶The SEC''s crackdowns on crypto platforms could also be contributing to this trend. Currently, exchanges hold about 2.09 million BTC, and the decrease in Bitcoin on exchanges is seen as a bullish signal.

5 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving period

If a deeper retrace is going to occur, it will likely be over the next 140 days or so (orange)

In fact, $BTC retraced -24% in 2015 and -38% in 2019 at this same point in the cycle (i.e. ~200 days before the Halving)

A -30% drop from current prices would see Bitcoin revisit ~$20,000

2. Pre-Halving rally

Then ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

In anticipation of the Halving, investors "Buy the Hype" in an effort to "Sell the News"

3. Pre-Halving retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur around the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep

This Pre-Halving retrace makes investors question whether the Halving was a bullish catalyst on price after all

4. Re-Accumulation

The Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

5. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new All Time Highs

1. Monday High was deviated, limit sells above pushed price back down when longs closing further puked price.

However, Monday Lower is much open and bulls are trying to defend price here above the yearly open. But once monday high is swept, natural short target is Monday Low.

2. Yearly Open above $42,400 is the area to hold for bullish LTF structure.

3. Limit orders on Binance trying to fight off late perp shorters. Biggest challenge for bulls is spot selling.

4. Perp longs from much lower have taken profit, but there is still a small perp premium. More aggressive buying at current levels is last hope for bulls.

Pick your fighter! 😉

Our bets are on Michael Saylor ... for now.

The BTC-Gold ratio seems to be in a major Expanding Diagonal with another leg higher.

EW rules give us, that the ratio may end at 53 or at 65 (in this non-log. chart).

So... 65 in favor for Michael Saylor? 😉🚀

Outlook: Bullish momentum could trigger $1 billion in short position liquidations, potentially propelling the market upward

Bitcoin is still technically in the Pre-Halving Retrace phase of its cycle (dark blue circle)

But this phase is all about setting up the next phase: the Re-Accumulation phase (red) 

This recent rejection from $70k has given us a better idea where the Re-Accumulation Range High resistance is (red horizontal)

Now it''s all about figuring out where the Re-Accumulation Range Low will be (green horizontal)

For now, the -18% Pre-Halving Retrace has potentially marked the bottom of this Re-Accumulation Range

If ~$60,000 continues to be the bottom...

BTC may consolidate between $60k & $70k for the coming weeks going into the Halving and beyond

Additionally, a lot of previous cycle signposts have been absent and/or entirely invalid

1. The conventional ‘risk curve’ trade of BTC —> ETH —> large caps —> mid caps —> shitters has been unprofitable. Barbell portfolio of BTC + memes has dominated. 

2. ETH/BTC has been remarkably weak, whereas historically it has benefitted from a risk on environment. This has also spilled over into ETH L1+L2 proxy trades being suboptimal. ‘Crypto as a casino’ thesis has been captured by memecoins on SOL (vs previous cycle’s casino was NFTs on ETH).

3. Memecoins have been consistently leading and rotating from that sector has been costly, whereas memes pumping has historically been an indicator of being late in the cycle. 

4. BTC hasn’t offered a series of previously ‘standard’ bull market pullbacks of 30-40%. This has created a bunch of early sellers/sidelined traders. Also led to proliferation of left-truncated cycle discourse, shorter cycle, super cycle, and other heterodox variants. 

5. There are so many new tokens (amplified by memecoins) that “crypto bull market” no longer means “everything that’s listed goes up for weeks/months” - the rising tide has not lifted all boats and there are very clear winners vs losers (and they’ve broadly stayed the same, no massive rotations e.g. ETH eco/L1+L2 trade been weak relative to SOL for ages, with exceptions).

Taking all this into account, it’s entirely plausible that you have Trader A who rode BTC, SOL, and memes and feels like stuff is hot and needs to cool off, whereas Trader B has barely made any money and feels like stuff hasn’t even picked up yet, and everything in between. 

We all have different portfolios, trading styles, time horizons, risk appetite, volatility tolerance, and a bunch of other stuff. 

Most of crypto Twitter thinks crypto will go up and to the right over time, we just disagree about the fine print.

Normally we hear, that Fed needs to cut rates for markets to rally.
It is incorrect!

Market rallies while Fed hikes - or when Fed Pauses.

Yesterday, we got #FOMC. We believed like majority of analysts, the Fed will continue the Pause.
It was BULLISH for markets"

There are solutions.

From today''s newsletter: https://t.co/5vbVIILxrF', '1762585563813580917.png', 'Sidelined - Now What? The ‘sidelinoor’ meme is an interesting one.  As much fun as it is to goad the (often hallucinated) ‘other side’ of your successful trade, it raises some interesting questions.  1. If you are trading exceptionally well and are thoroughly confident and in profit, why waste mental energy on market participants that are not in the same trade as you?  2. Sidelined traders aren’t your counterparties, by definition. Buyers are filled by sellers, and vice versa. If you’re gonna make fun of anyone (not that we recommend this) make fun of those filling your buy orders and getting liquidated, not those absent from the orderbooks.  3. Itis in your interest for sidelined traders to stay sidelined! If they deploy, the amount of net future buyers goes down and your side of the trade risks becoming crowded. If anything, you want the sidelined traders to stay sidelined for as long as possible, and once they finally surrender and emotionally buy at bad prices, you derisk into them.  Pseudo Intellectual excursions aside, we''ve written at length about lockout trends and dealing with them. Cred even has a well-timed blog post from some time ago on trading trending conditions.  To keep it frank, if you''re feeling completely sidelined and spend your days paralysed by your lack of exposure as the market has crept higher to all-time highs on the majors, you have some potential choices to make.  Before outlining them, what’s most important is that you stop living in the past. The past is the past. You can''t trade or change the past. It''s a fruitless, circular loop of self-loathing that will get you nowhere. Your job is to trade today’s market with today''s prices based on today’s data. Anything that doesn''t serve that purpose is to your detriment as a trader. This becomes especially dangerous if you fuel your present decision-making with your past regrets e.g. "I missed Y but if I leverage enough with X I can make up for itl’, Bad idea.  Now, you have options, but none of them are particularly pretty. But we keep it frank, so here they are anyway. This will lack a lot of nuance and doesn’t really account for individual trading strategies, time frames, trading vs investing, risk appetite, and so on. But here we go.  1. Bite the bullet. Just buy. In doing so, you at the very least ‘buy back’ your rationality and peace of mind if everything teleports far beyond your expectations. This is intended to jolt you awake from your sidelined slumber. For some people, getting any exposure above 0 makes them feel significantly better and breaks the paralysis. In other cases, whatever spot allocation you were saving for $12k Bitcoin - deploy it in a single clip. What if you bite the bullet and the market goes down? Too bad - you are not owed the luxury of a good entry, and as long as you aren''t overleveraged or buying spot, you can generally avoid liquidation. Consider keeping at least some cash so you''re not a deer in headlights if you buy the top and get the discounts you’ve been waiting for the whole time.  2. Wait. Great advice - stay sidelined! Jokes aside, as difficult as it is to believe given the absence of any high time frame pullbacks, they will come eventually. Whether it''s from here, $70k Bitcoin, $100k Bitcoin - nobody knows. But eventually tides turn and present opportunities. It may not be exactly at the price(s) you wanted, it may not align perfectly with previous cycles’ corrections, and it may take more or less time than usual - but it’ll happen eventually. The most important thing is to be price-agnostic as to the pullbacks i.e. doesn’t matter what price it''s coming from, the setup is the pullback itself. The risks? Expecting too much of a pullback and not deploying because you wanted a larger correction. Oh, and there''s a risk that you buy the pullback after the trend has ended and get smoked anyway. We said these answers aren''t pretty, but they’re honest.  3. Submit to lower time frames. This is a subcategory of (1) i.e. a form of biting the bullet, but with a bit more technical nuance. Get rid of those monthly charts (that''s right, Cred, fuck off) and get out your low time frames and low time frame trend following tools. Fast-moving trend tools, daily opens, very low time frame ranges and breakouts, very shallow low time frame pullbacks, and even, God forbid, diagonal trendline breakouts. In essence, you become apathetic to the historical price and laser focus on the market as it is now. The risk? You buy the low time frame trend at a time when the medium to high time frame trends reversal. You get smoked. Too bad - cost of doing business. Keep some cash and buy the dip you were waiting for in the first place.  No conclusion, that’s it. Thanks for reading. Use our shill link, or something.  Bye. ', '', False, NULL, False, 113160, 1220, 116, 123, 629515, 7502.90, 7.20), (18076, '2024-02-26 18:28:02.000000', 1762182753951379873, 'CryptoCred', 899558268795842561, 'twitter', 'The Importance of Divergence in Trading

I''ve had a rough personal week (non-trading related, hard to have a rough week when you trade the 10-year chart) and writing helps me feel better. Sorry for the absence and for the long form. Maybe it helps someone. Or not. It''ll help me at least. Here it is anyway.

Some form of divergence is often the cornerstone of good trade ideas.

While technical analysis momentum oscillator sycophants have effectively monopolised the term in trading parlance, divergence has much broader application.

The ordinary definition of divergence is "the situation in which two things become different".

How does this apply to trading?

A lot of trade ideas, at their core, operate on the premise (or assumption) that something is mispriced. More colloquially, that something doesn''t add up or is out of line.

If you bet accordingly and you''re right, the divergence resolves and become convergence.

A simple example that readers will likely be familiar with is a momentum oscillator (here we go again) standard divergence trade e.g. price making a lower low while the momentum oscillator makes a higher low. 

In this instance, the divergence is between price (lower low) and the momentum oscillator (higher low). Up until that stage, those two data points were acting in concert. Now that they are diverging, the implicit assumption is that one of them is wrong.

If you buy and you''re right, price will no longer diverge from the momentum oscillator signal and instead converge by moving higher - thus resolving the divergence. 

If you buy and you''re wrong, price will continue to move lower and the momentum oscillator higher low will converge by also making a lower low - thus resolving the divergence. 

In both cases the divergence ultimately gets resolved. One of the signals was ''bluffing'', but both outcomes resulted in a convergence.

Essentially, if you think of divergences as "This doesn''t add up - which signal is bluffing?" they can give rise to many fruitful avenues for investigation which may form into trade ideas.

A list of some examples, inexhaustive and in no particular order:

1. Price and Momentum (again)

Without rolling with the pigs in debating standard vs hidden divergences, appropriate candlestick lookback periods etc. - the core premise of a standard momentum divergence is that price and the momentum oscillator are offering contradictory signals.

While some divergence signals resolve in an anticlimactic fashion (e.g. price just goes sideways and oscillators ''reset'') these setups can give rise to powerful reversal and continuation signals.

Regarding reversals, especially when the setup is formed in tandem with other technical and non-technical factors, the premise of the trade is that the market is rising on weakening buy momentum/falling on weakening sell momentum, and that the divergence will resolve with price aligning with the momentum oscillator.

Regarding continuation - and these setups are especially pertinent in strong trends - the premise of the trade is that the momentum divergence is ''bait'' and that the reversal traders will get run over by a strong overarching trend.

There are some nuances with regarding to distinguishing divergence reversal from divergence continuation (overarching trend, proximity to breakout/breakdown level, time frame, shallow retrace/consolidation to ''reset'' oscillator values etc.) but they are beyond the scope of this specific article.

In summary, price and momentum are an interesting pair that warrants your attention.

2. Price and Delta

This falls under the broad criterion of ''Advanced Europoor Order Flow Beartard Tools (AEOFBT)'' and generally refers to the divergence between price and active order flow tools - particularly delta and (to a lesser extent) CVD.

Delta and CVD essentially outline aggressive market participants'' behaviour. The term "aggressive" describes participants willing to cross the spread i.e. execute via market orders.

As per the futures article, this is already an imperfect measure as it''s possible (and indeed a frequent occurrence, especially in BTC and ETH) to execute aggressively without specifically using market orders e.g. ''limit take'', limit chase, pushing perps around to fill larger spot orders etc. - but let''s go with the basic assumptions for now.

Without rewriting said futures article(s), the interesting divergences are between the magnitude of the aggressors'' effort and the corresponding price impact.

Generally, delta and price move in concert. Market buyers buy harder than market sellers - number go up. Market sellers sell harder than market buyers - number go down (with a ton of caveats, as usual).

Divergences form when:

1. Market buyers buy hard (either in absolute terms or relative to the recent activity, relative to the range the market is in etc.) but the market barely moves up.

2. Market sellers sell hard (same qualifier) but the market barely moves down.

This can also be imperfectly visualised using CVD e.g. price lower high/delta higher high, or weaker form price higher high/delta lower high.

In both cases, the divergence is between the aggressive participants and their corresponding price impact.

''Under the hood'' this is often a result of passive orders absorbing the market orders, with a lot more size to boot.

Like many divergences, it can also resolve in continuation not reversal e.g. instances where price-insensitive insider launches a clip at market, gets soaked up at first by limit orders that don''t know any better, and then the news/catalyst comes out and the limit orders get run over.

In summary, divergence between price and delta (broadly defined) can create interesting short to medium-term trade setups.

3. Price and Premium

"Premium" generally refers to the difference between the spot price of an instrument (or a basket of spot prices, creating an index price) and the price of a future, perpetual swap, or other derivative.

Given the latter category offers leverage and is the market''s preferred conduit for speculation, one can look at the premium as a measure of both:

1. How much are longs willing to pay to have long exposure?

2. How attractive (in terms of "yield" (lol)) is the short side or the arb trade e.g. buy spot, sell future, collect funding/basis?

Divergences can take many forms here, and as before, I''ve covered them at length in my futures article on Medium.

In my view, the most powerful versions are:

1. Significant (either in absolute terms or relative to recent numbers) spike in premium + correspondingly weak price action - longs that are paying a lot in funding yet not getting paid in PnL may become paper-handed.

2. Persistent (or even increasing) premium as price declines - either perps buying the dip with leverage or spot leading the nuke by selling harder than perps can keep up with (not great in either case).

3. These can be more or less inverted to get the other side of the trade i.e. funding becoming more negative as price rallies harder or basis getting squashed/perps aggressively selling without price moving lower etc.

In summary, when looking for trade ideas in the relationship between price and futures premia, you can ask: "Is one side of the market paying a lot to hold their positions, and are they getting what they paid for?"

Note: I was going to have a section on Price and Open Interest, but I''ve covered that exhaustively as its own blog post before. If you want a comprehensive-ish look at funding, CVD, OI etc. - read that article, no use rehashing it here.

4. Price and Sentiment

This one is a bit tricky given there''s no ''objective'' measure of sentiment. If anything, funding rates/premia are a decent proxy measurement for sentiment, which would take us back to (3).

Additionally, your view of sentiment can be completely skewed depending on your geography, social media algos, group of friends (are they European?), and so on. 

Nevertheless, I''ve seen enough good traders use this imperfect tool as the basis for sound trade ideas.

Divergence between price and sentiment (however defined) can take a few forms, but in my opinion these are the most interesting ones:

1. Price up, sentiment bullish disproportionately.
2. Price down, sentiment bearish disproportionately.
3. Price up, sentiment bearish disproportionately.
4. Price down, sentiment bullish disproportionately.

If I had to subcategorise these, I''d posit that (1) and (2) are reversal-type setups whereas (3) and (4) are continuation-type setups.

For (1) and (2), the divergence is between the fervour of cheerleading the move relative to the size of the move itself. Foaming at the mouth at every slight price movement is a ''tell'' for being exceedingly leveraged (or having religious levels of belief in the dominant trend), hence why it tends to crop up at opportune times for reversals. 

For (3) and (4), the divergence is between what the market is actually doing and how participants are interpreting it. In essence - disbelief, or apathy given an absolutist belief in the dominant trend. Up in a bear market? Dead cat bounce. You fell for it. This will end like every green candle has ended. Full retrace. Down in a bull market? This red candle is God''s gift to man. Every 0.1% pullback is generational. Buying anything red will free you from serfdom. 

In summary, this one is a bit slippery, but divergence between price and sentiment when the sentiment is particularly entrenched (and socially accepted/rewarded, while the ''other side'' is shunned) can offer interesting trade ideas.

5. Price and News

Divergence between price and news is consistently one of the best trade setups in crypto.

More often than not, the market''s reaction to the news is more informative than the news itself.

In a strong uptrend, random fluff nonsense that looks half-bullish can send asset prices soaring. The same news would barely have any impact in a bear market.

In a strong downtrend, anything remotely negative can crater the token price. Even bullish news can lead to lower prices if it''s sufficiently priced in, underwhelming, or attracts enough buyers in a market hungry for exit liquidity.

In my view, when it comes to price and news divergence, there are 4 strong setups and 2 weak setups.

Strong setups:

1. Good news in a strong uptrend stops having positive market impact/starts being sold.

2. Bad news in a strong downtrend stops having negative market impact/starts getting bought.

3. Bad news in a strong uptrend has minimal impact/gets absorbed immediately.

4. Good news in a strong downtrend has minimal impact/gets absorbed immediately.

(1) and (2) generally work best at macro inflection points to hint towards reversal of the dominant trend, whereas (3) and (4) generally work best when things speed up in a new dominant trend i.e. (1) and (2) are late cycle signals of reversal, whereas (3) and (4) are more early-mid cycle signals of continuation. Tons of caveats, as usual.

Weak setups:

5. Good news in a strong uptrend has visibly less positive impact.

6. Bad news in a strong downtrend has visibly less negative impact.

(1)-(4) are categorised as "strong" because they present a stronger divergence between price and news - the market is doing the opposite of what the news would ordinarily cause.

(5) and (6) are categorized as "weak" (in relative terms) because they are not so much an explicit divergence, but more so a signal that market participants are becoming less sensitive to the impact of news and/or that a lot of the good or bad stuff has been priced in.

In summary, price and news is really worth your time - it is relevant on a multitude of time frames and can be used as confluence for a range of trade ideas (as well forming trade ideas on its own).

6. Relative Strength

Initially I planned to do a separate point on pairs trading i.e. Walmart stat arb by looking at strong/weak pairs in a closely correlated basket of instruments, but relative strength as a catch-all is probably more helpful.

The divergence here is simple: it is between the returns (positive or negative) of a given instrument or group of instruments relative to the rest of the market.

In a Hsakaesque fashion, it is finding the stuff that is strong during broad market weakness and inferring (or assuming, if you''re less epistemologically generous) that said stuff will also be strong once the market mean reverts.

Colloquially, "If this thing is strong when everything is weak, imagine how strong it''ll be when everything bounces!"

We can get into nerdy window-dressing explanation of how strength during market weakness can be indicative of passive, layered bids from smarter participants who are less sensitive to downside volatility, using relative strength as a proxy measurement for market attention, and so on but it all circles to the same point - divergence between a certain instrument (or closely correlated basket) and the rest of the market can highlight pockets of strength.

It works the other way around too (albeit to a lesser extent) i.e. stuff that''s weak during market weakness will probably be weak on the bounce, but there are weird exceptions to this e.g. if it was strong previously, tons of new OI and aggressive buyers at the top, market flushes, top buyers get liqd and their liqs push price significantly lower than it would be otherwise --> "OMG relative weakness" (it''s actually not, it''s just liqs) --> bounces hard --> wow it was relatively weak but bounced hard, Cred''s dumb essay was a scam I wished he stayed off Twitter.

In summary, divergence between specific instruments or baskets relative to the market''s mean returns (or even intrabasket if you want to get bougie with it) can serve as an effective filter when trading a market with near infinite altcoins.

Conclusion

As mentioned in the beginning, this list is by no means exhaustive and is riddled with assumptions, oversimplification, and is unnecessarily verbose in places.

But hopefully it gets you thinking about how to structure some trade ideas.

In any case, I feel better having written this and hope it helps.

After an initial failed breakout on dominance we are going for a second attempt:

Every successful breakout on Bitcomin dominance has ushered in a major impulse on Bitcoin leading to out-performance against most alts and multi-thousand dollar moves to the upside as seen here:

$BTC sits just $10,000 below prior all time highs yet funding has been reset and is at baseline while the recent spike in perp premiums has dissipated- which is extremely healthy and indicates that despite the mega-run of the last few days the market is not frothy at all and spot demand at these levels is incredibly strong:

Finally, major meme-coins are moving right now and these are usually the LAST to move in a Bitcoin -> high caps -> mid caps -> low caps -> meme coins rotation. 

Typically this rotation to meme coins marks the end of mini "alt cycles" or windows where alts may outperform while Bitcoin readies for the next leg. 

I think $BTC probably takes the spotlight again soon due to all of the above, and this makes sense, especially if we are about to break prior ATH''s and head into price discovery where we will see daily, weekly and monthly moves larger than anything we have seen in the last 3-4 years.

Now the BTC Miners have performed even better. #CLSK is up ~152% in February alone.

Since the November 2022 Bear Market Bottom...

Bitcoin has experienced the following retraces:

• -23% (February 2023) lasting 21 days

• -21% (April/May 2023) lasting 63 days

• -22% (July/September 2023) lasting 63 days

• -21% (January 2023) lasting 14 days

This current pullback is only the 5th major retrace since the 2022 Bear Market Bottom

All of the pullbacks experienced just over -20% retracement depth

Bitcoin has pulled back -16% thus far

But the retrace began only last Thursday

The current retrace has therefore barely lasted a week

In sum, there are two key takeaways about retracements in this current cycle:

• The closer Bitcoin gets to a -20% retrace, the better the opportunity becomes

• Retraces need time to fully mature (at least 2-3 weeks, at most 2-months)

Bitcoin has officially entered the "Danger Zone" (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun

Historically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving

In 2020, this retrace was -20% deep

4 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving

1. Pre-Halving Rally

Approximately 30 days remain until the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024

And ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue)

History has repeated in this respect

In fact, the Pre-Halving Rally breakout was a little ahead of schedule by a handful of days

However, Bitcoin is now slowly transitioning away from its "Pre-Halving Rally" phase and into its "Pre-Halving Retrace" phase

Pre-Halving Retrace tends to occur approximately 28 to 14 days before the Halving

And with Bitcoin having pulled back -11% last week, it is looking like history is once again repeating

In fact, much like the Pre-Halving Rally, it looks like the Pre-Halving Retrace may be a little ahead of schedule by a handful of days as well

Nonetheless, if this current downside continues in the coming weeks, this will be the confirmation that the Pre-Halving Retrace is firmly underway

So even though Bitcoin has performed a historic, never-before-done feat in its price action in the Pre-Halving period by breaking to new All Time Highs...

Still history has found a way to repeat itself

The "Pre-Halving Rally" began pretty much right on schedule

And it also appears like the "Pre-Halving Retrace" is beginning pretty much right on schedule as well

Th Pre-Halving Rally phase has been extensive but it may very well be ending as we speak

The next step is the "Pre-Halving Retrace" phase

2. Final Pre-Halving Retrace

A Pre-Halving retrace tends to occur a 28 to 14 days before the Halving event itself (dark blue circle)

In 2016, this Pre-Halving retrace was -38% deep

In 2020, this Pre-Halving retrace was -20% deep

Currently, $BTC is 30 days away from the Halving and has pulled back -11% last week

This Pre-Halving retrace can last multiple weeks and up to 77 days

This year, Bitcoin has experienced a -18% pullback in January, a -14% pullback in early March, and now a -11% pullback is in progress

Therefore it''s possible a Pre-Halving Retrace, should one occur, would more likely be on the shallower side than on the deeper side

Also, this Pre-Halving Retrace could also be much shorter than has otherwise been the case historically

3. Re-Accumulation

The Pre-Halving retrace is followed by multi-month re-accumulation (red)

This period can last up to 150 days (i.e 5 months)

Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving

However, in this cycle it would be the very first time that this Re-Accumulation Range could develop around the New All Time High area

As a result, this Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation

4. Parabolic Uptrend

Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green)

It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend

Historically, this phase has lasted just over a year (~385 days) however with a potential Accelerated Cycle occurring right now, this figure may get cut in half in this market cycle

In an uptrend, price fails to make a new high. In a downtrend, price fails to break through an old low  Liquidity refers to the number of trades taken on a particular asset, how much of it is being exchanged between buyers and sellers.  A Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) can be used for traders to take advantage of stop-loss orders above a key swing high or below a key swing low in order to create the liquidity needed to move the price in the opposite direction.  Trading the Swing-Failure Pattern  Find a key high/low or a defined STEP I . fange. Key highs/ lows are points  from where a price following a trend reverses or starts ranging.

I prefer to wait for confirmation of the ‘sweep’ candle to take the short.  STEP 3: Define Stop-Loss and Target  Not every sweep of a high/low is an SFP. Use the notes on liquidity. Ask yourself, where would a retail trader place stops or be baited to take aposition. You need to understand how retail trades and go against that.  Entry: On close of the candle that sweeps the high/low. 2nd entry (optional): Candle after the sweep closes below/above the high/lowas well.  Stop-Loss: Level of the wick of the ‘sweep’ candle.

1. We lost the Bull/Bear line and rejected from 4H trend, we remain HTF bearish for now. The only argument is how much worse can it get? And we can''t trade off that logic.

2. There''s a massive OI increase today across all exchanges and it''s mostly people trying to buy the dip on leverage. This is not a healthy sign and hence I''ve not taken any longs.

Additionally, this is now happening under the range VaL, I''m only interested in buying capitulation bottoms or a shorting a rejection of previous range VaL if we get it now.

3. The constant spot premium since the local bottom around $59,600 has reduced today, this again adds to point 2, apes buying on leverage is not a good sign.

4. Funding consistently positive, leveraged longs argument supported.

5. We''ve moved around 6% lower since the local BTC highs around $65,000, and there are no large long liquidations yet. Does not have the characteristics of a bottom yet IMO.

Also not interesting in shorting at these levels, I was not awake when we rejected from 4H trend and POC, so not FOMO shorting now.', '1785302077612470453.png', 'BICUSOT, 2h, Os16s9.0 H61770.0 L61116.0 €61205.3 -453.7 (-0.74%)  Binance-Futures EM (200, close, 0, SMA, 9) 6-4  ye  “OH gama  1.

For them, Being right is more important than making money.

Brother you are just a cartoon character on the internet.

I have been wrong so many times.

When we Dumped to 16K, I expected us to Fall Down to 12K. I Predicted this Publicly but then the news of FED cutting rates came and I knew market had Changed. I was Proven wrong Publicly.

What did I do? I went Long and made Tonnes of Money and said it Publicly that I was wrong and now I am long since market has Changed.

Same with recent events.

I really expected us to Pump to 80K.

But a lot of Negative Events, Israel-Iran conflict and new news about FOMC delaying rate Cut.

I knew these were Negative and we will take a lot of time to reach 80K and needed some Dump.

I changed my View and Sold a lot of Spot.

I then also Went Swing long Publicly and announced it.

Made good money there.

Truth is, people are waiting for you to be wrong once and then make fun of you.

You can''t let that Bother you. Be free and open to change your Bias. Concentrate on making that Money.

The Bitcoin "Danger Zone"

The Bitcoin Pre-Halving "Danger Zone" (orange) is where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun

Historically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving

This cycle was no different and here''s why:

Because Bitcoin experienced its first -18% Pre-Halving Retrace approximately 30 days before the Halving

History repeated in that respect

In fact, in 2016 Bitcoin began its Pre-Halving Retrace 28 days before the Halving and in 2024 it was 30 days before the Halving

This 2024 closely mirrored the 2016 in this respect

Which is why it is perhaps worth looking at a possible Post-Halving "Danger Zone" (purple)

The Bitcoin Post-Halving "Danger Zone"

In 2016, Bitcoin produced a long -11% downside wick approximately 21 days after the Halving before reversing towards the upside

Bitcoin is currently 11 days after the Halving

But 2016 history suggests that if downside volatility around the Re-Accumulation Range Low (green horizontal level) is going to occur in this cycle...

It could occur over the next coming 10 days (i.e. purple "Danger Zone")

The purple Post-Halving "Danger Zone" ends in 10 days but 2016 history suggests that in the meantime downside volatility at the $60600 Range Low is a possibility

In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the Halving

In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the Halving

If history repeats and the next Bull Market peak occurs 518-546 days after the Halving...

That would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September or mid-October 2025

Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 220 days

So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronising this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle

In the 2015-2017 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the Halving

In the 2019-2021 cycle, Bitcoin peaked 546 days after the Halving

If history repeats and the next Bull Market peak occurs 518-546 days after the Halving...

That would mean Bitcoin could peak in this cycle in mid-September or mid-October 2025

Currently, Bitcoin is accelerating in this cycle by approximately 180 days

So the longer Bitcoin consolidates after the Halving, the better it will be for resynchronising this current cycle with the traditional Halving cycle

However, Bitcoin has now been consolidating between ~$60000-$70000 for over two months now

ok so like ETF is bullish but why is price action so slow? we had the god candle but it''s been sideways since then. not sure if impatient or sign of weakness. bullish argument is that BTC ETF was very telegraphed and still mooned after the ETF itself went live - meta shifted from ''frontrun the ETF news'' to ''frontrun the ETF flows''. so you''d think with virtually no time to front run the ETH ETF compared to BTC (approval odds went from 0 to 100), that leaves more room for upside as crypto natives pivot --> front run ETF itself --> front run flows themselves (in a much more narrow window). bearish argument is that actual ETH ETF flows are gonna be ass and we''ve already front run the event itself, and mediocre flows + ETHE dumping on our heads = bearish. but still feels retarded not being bullish into the ETF itself? especially with so many of the allocators being much more price insensitive than anticipated. that said, the ETF itself is a lot worse because no staking and shit, so that doesn''t help. so are we trapped in limbo whereby 1) done front running the news itself; 2) market waiting for flows to see if it''s gonna follow BTC-style trajectory? dunno man, I have range fatigue already.

No changes since last udpate - just my belief has solidified that we continue chopping for a few weeks. 

Scenario 1: (main)
- We continue upwards and move level to level not giving sideliners an entry
- Price has to move quickly over the weekend and into next week to make it happen

Scenario 2:
- Wick down ~$65-66,000. Quick recovery
- If we continue to chop this becomes more likely as positions are built up on either side of the range.

If history were to repeat, Bitcoin could experience a Bull Market peak in mid-September or mid-October 2025

But the rate of acceleration in this current cycle will also be a factor as to when that final peak will occur

Current rate of cycle acceleration is ~180 days

So if this figure persists for the remainder of the cycle then an April 2025 peak may need to be considered instead

Bitcoin has been in a downtrend since ~$71500

This sort of downtrending price action is not out of the ordinary by standards of history in the Post-Halving period

But when Bitcoin breaks its series of Lower Highs, Bitcoin will enjoy another bout of renewed buy-side momentum and upside

Bitcoin continues to reject at lower and lower prices, forming a series of Lower Highs

First Bitcoin rejected at ~$71500

Then price confirmed the blue square as a local topping area, as per recent history

And now $BTC is rejecting from the orange area as well

When this series of Lower Highs ends, that is when Bitcoin will start to pick back up again

In fact, it''s been too fast

Which is why this cycle needs to slow down, if it wants to resynchronise with normal Halving Cycles

BONK may have a tendency of retesting old Range Highs (black) as new support after breakout (green circle)

Could #BONK pullback into its recently broken Range High to fully confirm the latest breakout?

Post-breakout retests don''t always happen, especially when the buy-side pressure is strong, but such retests are great confirmation signals for further upside

Bitcoin continues to Daily Close below orange, further solidifying it as a point of resistance

Ideally, a Daily Close above $69400 would set price up for higher levels

Apart from lacking standardization on how crypto firms are assessed for underwriting, the same is true for asset valuation policies for fund managers.

Having spoken with with many fund managers, fund admins & auditors, there is a lack of standardization on valuation policies, leading to wildly marked portfolios. 

It creates a situation where you can have five different fund managers holding the same asset, and marking them differently based on <reason>. 

This matters because it can influence LP decisions on further capital allocations towards that fund manager. There seems to be an incentive mismatch as LP''s want a clear picture of current performance, while GP''s need the numbers to look good for that next fundraise.
